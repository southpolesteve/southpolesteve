Finally, after 4 attempts to get a video on to YouTube, here it is!

As a side note, YouTube has started stripping the audio from videos where they
detect you are using a copyrighted song.  Luckily my other videos are fine,
but there are now thousands of videos on YouTube that are eerily silent.  And
yet again, the music industry continutes to piss off its own customers....
