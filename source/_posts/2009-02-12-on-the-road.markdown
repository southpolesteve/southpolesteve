Hey, sorry for no updates, but I have been on the road in New Zealand and
staying in places with little or no internet. No time to post either. We have
covered over 2000km in about 3.5 days, so been busy driving. I will try and
get a detailed update soon and post a few hundred pictures. I have also
finalized plans for leaving New Zealand. I am flying to Brisbane, Australia on
Feb 15th and to Singapore on Feb 20th. That's all I have time for right now.
More to come soon!
