Just a FYI.  There is a really good way to view pictures in the gallery.
Click on the link that says "view with pic lens" and it will bring up a really
nice browser for all the images.  For you tech savvy people, you can also
install a add on to Firefox called Pic Lens that will allow you to browse
through the images on a sweet 3-d wall. [singlepic id=977 w=525]
