Arrived back in New Zealand last night at around 9pm.  Very glad to be back in
warm weather.  Not much of an update today, need to recharge my batteries, but
a quick list of important things:

  1. Anyone who was emailing me at faulknst@usap.gov, that email no longer works.  Please use southpolesteve@gmail.com now.
  2. I can use Skype again!  My user name is southpolesteve.  Hit me up anytime I am online.  There is a online status indicator on the side of the website and here:
  3. There will be a few more posts on Antarctica to cover some things I didn't get to while I was down there.
  4. No more walking outside to go to the bathroom!
  5. Travel map has been updated
