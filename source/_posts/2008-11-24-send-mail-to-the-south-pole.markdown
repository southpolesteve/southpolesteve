It turns out that you can send me mail while I am at the South Pole! Send it
to:

Steve Faulkner, A-333-S South Pole Station PSC 468 Box 400 APO AP 96598

Packages take up to 6 weeks to arrive so I would recommend sending a letter.
Letters take, on average, 5-14 days to arrive but can take longer depending on
the weather.
