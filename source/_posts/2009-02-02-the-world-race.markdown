My friend [Jamie Neumann](http://jamieneumann.theworldrace.org/) is leaving in
October for a HUGE adventure.  She is participating in a world-wide missionary
trip known as [The World Race](http://www.theworldrace.org/).  She will be
doing service missionary work in 11 countries in 11 months!  I think she
deserves some recognition for taking almost an entire year off for such a good
cause.

Here is the thing, she could also use your help!  Every world race participant
is responsible for raising money to fund their trip.  Click [here](https://www
.adventures.org/give/donate.asp?giveto=worldrace&desc=For%20Jamie%20Neumann&tu
id=133198) or on the link below to donate to her world race fund.  Please give
anything you can.  Jamie is a one of a kind person and you will be doing 11
countries a huge favor by sending her on this trip!
