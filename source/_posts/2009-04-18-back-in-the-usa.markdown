I'm back!  Arrived about a week ago and have been just relaxing since.  Sorry
for no updates, but there hasn't been a whole lot to report.  Feels good to be
back.  Now I am currently hunting for something to do next.  Well see what
happens...

In the mean time I found a cool new thing that allow you to chat with me right
from this website.  I am mostly on google chat, so you will see my current
status just below. Click right on it and a new window will pop up where you
can chat with me. No logging in.  Pretty sweet.  In encourage you to try it
out.
