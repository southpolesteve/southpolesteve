Ever since my trip to SE Asia, I can't eat like I used to.  Previously, I was
all about the junk food.  I still indulge every once and a while, but my
cravings for the unhealthy have definitely decreased.  [This blog
post](http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/06/presenting-a
-case-for-healthy-food.html) has some great links and videos about the food we
eat in the US and the associated industry. Some surprising stuff, you should
check it out. Makes me wish for a a few more "third world" meals.
