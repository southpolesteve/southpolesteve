At the South Pole, there are two places that people live.  The first is the
new South Pole Station.  It is quite comfortable and where I spend a lot of
time eating and socializing.  But  unfortunately that is not where my room is.
My room is located in the "Summer Camp" .

Summer Camp is a collection of a dozen or so buildings that are only used
during the South Pole summer.  Most of the buildings are insulated army-style
barracks built in the late 60's called Jamesways.  Pretty much everyone sleeps
in the Jamesways their first year, so its not out of the ordinary that I am
here.  None the less, it would still be much nicer to live in the new station.
Below is a composited picture of my room in the Jamesway:

The standard room consists of just a bed and a heavy canvas curtain as a door.
These room have been here for so long that many, including mine, have been
modified.  Some industrious person has constructed a desk , some shelves, and
added more insulation to the walls.  These rooms are also prone to air leaks
from the outside, but luckily many have been plugged with old towels.

The shelves are probably the most useful part, as the temperature can vary
widely from the top of the room to the bottom.  Anything left on the floor is
likely to freeze if left there for more than 24 hours.  On the opposite end,
it is upwards of 85° F  at the top near the heat duct.

Not the most comfortable living arrangements, but I only sleep there.  Most of
my free time is spent up a the station.  I will have to do another post about
South Pole recreation, but right now it is time to go to work...
