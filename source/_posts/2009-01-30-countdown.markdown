I have added a little countdown to the right side of the website.   Only 5
days to go!  Many of the other drillers are gone now, and there isn't much
left to do.

**Looking forward to:** Night sky Not walking outside to go to the bathroom 70 deg temps Different food.  Stuff here is pretty good, but it gets boring, need a change. Humidity Did I mention not walking outside to go to the bathroom? Not waking up in the middle of the night because its freezing in your room.  
Right now, every place in the world seems luxurious compared to Antarctica.
