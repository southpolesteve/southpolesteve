Just arrived at the hotel in Christchurch, New Zealand. I left Boston at
10:00am Dec. 28th and arrived here at 10:30am Dec. 30th. Quite the journey,
but it went pretty smoothly, no major issues. I should definitely give a shout
out to Qantas airlines. Hands down it was the most comfortable flight I have
ever taken. The 13+ hours went by pretty quick.

Its 85 deg and sunny here in Christchurch. Pretty warm compared to the -6 deg
at the pole. The next few days should be pretty relaxed, just exploring
Christchurch and getting issued my cold weather gear. Over New Years I have
arranged to meet up with some people from
[couchsurfing.com](http://www.couchsurfing.com) It will be my first experience
with other couch surfers, but hopefully it works out.

I have also added a travel map at the very top of the web page. This map will
show all the places I have been. Give it a look
