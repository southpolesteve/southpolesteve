[singlepic id=1348 float=right w=300] For the past few days I have really been
enjoying a city called Hoi An, Vietnam.  It is about half way between Saigon
and Hanoi.  The best part, it is the consensus tailor-made clothing capitol of
the region.  Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore all have many good tailors,
but Hoi An has hundreds; in a city of only 75,000 people.  They also have a
many good historical sites and some UNESCO world heritage ruins near by.

Unfortunately, I was sucked in by all of the nice clothes and bought a lot.
Of course, they look and fit fantastic.  I couldn't be happier and easily paid
less than 10% of what I would have paid for them in the US.  On top of this,
they are all custom tailored to my exact measurements.  Now I need to find a
job where linen and plaid suits are acceptable to wear to work.  I did get one
grey suit that is fairly tame, but the other clothes might be a little loud
for most office buildings.  On the other hand, I could just start a new
workplace trend.  Third option: I just don't get a job at all.

In other news, I woke up from a nap yesterday and had a deep desire to leave
Vietnam and go to Malaysia for the Grand Prix.  It is interesting because for
the last week I was fairly confident I would be going to China and the Chinese
Grand Prix.  Luckily I found a string of flights that got me to Kuala Lumpur
tonight.  The downside is that I am currently waiting in the Saigon airport
for the next 7 hours.  Regardless, I went with my gut, and I am excited to see
the grand prix this weekend.
