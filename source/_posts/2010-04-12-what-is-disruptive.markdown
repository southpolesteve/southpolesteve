Today's post inspired by: [http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-
disruptive.html](http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-disruptive.html)

I normally like the [Smart Bear blog.](http://blog.asmartbear.com) His advice
is very sound and seems more in touch with the common folk than some [other
blogs written from the clouds above Silicon Valley](http://blog.asmartbear.com
/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html).  But I didn't quite agree with Smart Bear's
words of wisdom today.  I'll agree that the "disruptive" label is overused,
but I actually think that some of the examples he gave are quite disruptive.
Changing the landscape of an entire industry, or drastically altering the
lives of XXX million users are not required criteria for being disruptive.
Anytime you can make a successful company from just [an
idea](http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html),
that is being disruptive.
