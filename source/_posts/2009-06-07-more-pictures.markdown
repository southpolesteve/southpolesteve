I have set up a completely new photo gallery on the site. I was running into
some problems with the old one, hence the change. More importantly, I have
also uploaded every picture stored on my computer.Â  The photos are all
organized by location and then activity so they should be easy to navigate.
Feel free to browse the thousands of photos I took of [temples in Cambodia](ht
tp://photos.southpolesteve.com/Cambodia/Siem%20Reap/Angkor%20Temples/) or some
photos from [Fenway Park in Boston](http://photos.southpolesteve.com/United%20
States/Massachusettes/Boston/Red%20Sox%20-%20Patriots%20Day%20Game/). Or maybe
you are just interested in [embarrassing photos of my friend Kayla](http://pho
tos.southpolesteve.com/United%20States/Illinois/img_1003.jpg.php).

Find the new gallery by clicking the pictures link at the top of the page or
going to [photos.southpolesteve.com](http://photos.southpolesteve.com) (no
WWW).
