Can't help but post about this again. GPS tracking for sailing is pretty
awesome! Today I sailed 25 total miles and had a max speed of almost 10 mph.
Thats pretty quick for a sailboat. Also, I did a bunch of practice landings
while under sail. You can see on the map below how I kept circling around and
landing at the pier and a pin in the mooring field. At the end of the season I
think I'll do a big summary that gives all kinds of interesting statistics
about my sailing this summer.
