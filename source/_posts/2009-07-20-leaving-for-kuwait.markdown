The time has come.  I am in Washington D.C. waiting to board the plane for
Kuwait.  The last couple weeks have been crazy getting everything ready to
leave.  I'm excited to start this new adventure, but a little sad too.  I have
to leave a bunch of friends behind, including an amazing girl named Megan.
Its only 8 months...time flies.

In other news, thanks to my dad, I get to fly out there business class - a 12
hour flight.  I fear that I will never be able to sit in coach again!

Look forward to lots of updates once I get there.
