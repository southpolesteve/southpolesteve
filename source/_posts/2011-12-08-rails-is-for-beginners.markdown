This morning I came across an article on hacker news titled [Rails Is Not For Beginners](http://www.horsesaysinternet.com/code/rails-is-not-for-beginners/). The article is actually about Sinatra, but the link-bait title is dead wrong. Rails is perfect for beginners and here is why ...

A friend of mine with zero programming experience recently asked me to help him learn web development. We setup rails together, and I pointed him to some online tutorials. When he called me the next evening, he could barely contain his excitement:
 
>"Rails is awesome! I can edit, add, delete! This is a real web app and I made it!"

In Rails, with only a few commands you can have a fully functioning CRUD app built on scaffolding. No experienced Rails developer I know uses scaffolding. So why is it still in the source code? Because Rails is for beginners. 

The best way to teach anyone web development is to inspire them to learn on their own. My friend is a long way from being a productive web developer, but because of Rails he is **excited** to learn more.

If you are a beginner and looking for a place to start, I recommend [railstutorial.org](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/). It is a fantastic resource, and best of all the online version is free.
