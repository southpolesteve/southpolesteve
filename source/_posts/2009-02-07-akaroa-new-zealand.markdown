[singlepic id=525 w=200 float=right] Today, some drillers and I took a day
trip out to the Banks Peninsula and the town of Akaroa. It is a small touristy
village with boat cruises, sea kayaking, and whale watching. We mostly just
bummed around town all afternoon and then headed back tonight. While we were
in town they had a pretty neat airshow. This was apparently related to the
national holiday that was yesterday - [Waitangi
Day](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi_Day). The country side was also
quite beautiful so you will have to check out some of the pictures in the
album.  Reminds me a lot of the costal hills in California combined with a
seaside Oregon town.  Also, lots of sheep were present.  Fact: There are more
sheep than people in New Zealand.

Edit: Whoops, I had that fact turned around before
