Sorry again for the lack of updates lately. I left Kuwait and came back to
Madison. Feels so good to be out of that country. I have moved into a place in
Madison that I will call home for the next 4 months. It is especially exciting
because I have two Danish roommates and one Australian. Through them and their
friends, I am getting a chance to meet people from all over the world right
here in Madison! Its been a ton of fun so far. For my birthday last night,
they made me a traditional danish dinner. We have been having a good time
learning about each others cultures. This semester should be great.

In other news, I am going to Colombia tomorrow. Just for fun. My friend
Jersey, who lives in the Dutch Antilles, has some time off and we are going to
bum around Bogota. Should be an awesome and exciting week! And one more
continent checked off the list. Only Europe and Africa to go...
