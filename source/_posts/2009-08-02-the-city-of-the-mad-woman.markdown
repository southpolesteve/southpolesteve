Today, I had my second day off since I got here.  The first day, I was still
out of it from jet lag. This is the first chance I have had to really do some
exploring.  The city I live in is called Mahboula, which I just found out is
Arabic for "mad woman".  Its roughly 10 miles south of Kuwait City.

I spent the morning up in Kuwait City, going to several malls and trying to
find some good fake stuff.  Sadly, I was kind of dissapointed.  The fake stuff
in SE Asia is way better quality and cheaper.  I did go to some nicer malls as
well.  They have lots of big name brands just like in the US, but almost
everything is twice to three times as expensive.  In the afternoon I hit the
beach.  The water is very salty here.  I feel like it is saltier than normal
ocean water.

Next day off, I am going to try and take a ferry off the coast to Failaka
Island.  There are supposed to be some cool ruins there and also remnants of
the Iraqi invasion like tanks and jeeps.

Also, a lot of people have heard already, but I will be leaving much sooner
than expected.  I was supposed to be out here for 8 months, but I just quit my
job.  It was a hard thing for me to do, and there are a lot of reasons behind
it, but its the right decision.
