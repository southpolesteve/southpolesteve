Two long days of work so far at 12+ hour shifts.  Work has been a little rough
getting going.  Lots of logistical issues.  Today we have off, and then we go
back to work on Sunday.  There has been a little excitement.  Yesterday
afternoon, I was out on a test drive for one of the trucks and we ran out of
fuel.  It was 3 of us stuck in the desert for 2 hours in 115 deg heat waiting
for resuce.

Pics will hopefully be up soon.  Interestingly, its illegal to take pictures
of most everything here.  Malls, oil installations, warehouses, public
buildings, etc.  Security is very tight.  One of the guys I work with was
almost arrested last year for taking a picture of a Burger King.
