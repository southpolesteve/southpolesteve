This is starting to make some mainstream headlines.  It's not entirely
benevolent on Google's part, but the idea of a single company taking on an
entire government is interesting.  I think it's with good intentions this
time, but what is to say this kind of pressuring can't happen when the company
has less noble motives.  The truth is that it probably does happen but rarely
makes the evening news.
