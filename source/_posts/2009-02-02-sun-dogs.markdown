[singlepic id=509 w=250 float=right]There is a pretty cool atmospheric
phenomon here called [sun dogs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog).  They
are false images of the sun that are caused by light being bent by ice
crystals in the upper atmosphere.  Sun dogs are similar to rainbows, but are
created by ice crystals instead of water droplets.  These occur all over the
world, but they are the brightest at extremely cold temperatures - South Pole
sounds like a pefect place.  They were much more prevelent earlier in the
season because the sun was closer to to the ideal angle.  The picture at the
left shows the sun blocked out.  You can see one sun dog and the two halos
that are also often visible.  On extremely clear days its not uncommon to see
three complete halos around the sun, two sun dogs nearly as bright as the sun,
and one halo that goes all the way around your head.
