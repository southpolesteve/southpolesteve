After a few lazy days in Bangkok, I am headed to Cambodia tomorrow.  I was
actually quite close to booking a flight home, but then something pretty
amazing happened.  Through [couchsurfing](http://www.couchsurfing.com), I met
a girl from NYC doing a photo essay on travelers.  She took me on some local
tours of Bangkok and got me convinced not to end my trip quite yet.

It is sometimes crazy how life gives you what you need, right when you need
it.
