Hey everyone, sorry for no updates ove the past few days, but the place I was
at in Australia had no internet.  I just arrived in Singapore.  The travel map
is updated.  I took a lot of pictures in Australia and I will post them as
soon as I get the chance.  The two highlights of Australia were definitely
surfing and handfeeding Kangaroos.  Today I am trying to get some visas in
Singapore and explore the city a little bit.  More later!
