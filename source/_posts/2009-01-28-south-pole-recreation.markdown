Today I wanted to post some pictures of what we do for fun here at the Pole.
Not much time before work this morning, so I  will be brief.

Here is where we eat.  The Galley.  Food is all served buffet style.  For more
on the food, see my previous post
[here](http://www.southpolesteve.com/?p=115).

The station also has a grow room for fresh vegetables.  I usually go here to
make telephone calls.  It is quiet, there is a couch, and best of all it has a
normal humidity

There are two lounges on station where we watch movies and can play video
games.  The station has  a pretty imense library of DVD's, VHS, and even
BetaMax.

One of the lounges also has a pool table

There is an arts and crafts room.  I haven't made it in there very much.

Twice a week I play some basketball in the Gym.  Playing basketball at 10,000
ft is quite exhausting.  The dry air also makes it difficult to breathe.

The last room rec room is a music room.  They have some pretty nice music
gear.  Several [Fender American](http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product
/Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar?sku=515748) guitars and
a [Gibson SG](http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Gibson-SG-Standard-
Electric-Guitar?sku=517265).  They even have two carbon fiber[ acoustic guitar

But, even with all the stuff to do, the drill crew spends a lot of time just
sitting around, talking, and drinking.
