I am in a dilema.  Currently I am in Vietnam. The original plan was to fly to
Malaysia for the Formula One race, but that will leave me 10 days or less in
Vietnam.  I really would like to go to a Grand Prix, so the next option is to
head north and hit the Grand Prix of China in mid-April.  So I am putting the
question to the readers!  What do you think I should do?  Vote now!
