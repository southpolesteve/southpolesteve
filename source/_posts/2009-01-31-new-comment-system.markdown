A quick post unrelated to South Pole adventures.

I have just installed a new comment system on the site.  It should have a lot
more features than the previous one.  One of the cool features is that you can
respond to other people's comments.  Next to every comment there is a reply
link.  Just click on that and type away.  This also means that I can start
responding to your comments directly.  Also, if you want to get notified by
email if someone responds to your comment, there is a check box when you post
that will do that.

Hope everyone enjoys it!  If something isn't working right, just let me know.
