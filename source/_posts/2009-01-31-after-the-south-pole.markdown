[singlepic id=503 w=250 float=right]A common question people ask:

_"What are you doing after you leave the South Pole?"_

The answer: Traveling the world!

The initial plan is to spend some time in New Zealand. IceCube pays for 4
nights of hotel in Christchurch, so I will definitely take advantage of that.
On Feb 9th it is looking like I will head up to the mountains with a few other
drillers. We will be taking a helicopter up to a remote cabin in the middle of
the Southern Alps. Here is a map of its location and above is a picture from
the air.  If you click on either picture, you should be able to see a bigger
version.

After the trip to the mountains things are still in limbo.  The general plan
is to fly to Brisbane, Australia to visit my friend Jack who is studying
abroad.  Then fly to Singapore, take a train/bus to Phuket, Thailand to visit
my friend Annie.  The train and bus system in SE Asia is very cheap, so I hope
to travel around to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China if I can get a visa.
After that, who knows?

Of course if anyone wants to come join me in SE Asia there is an open
invitation.  Getting there can be expensive from the US, but staying there is
extremely cheap.

Along the way I will continue posting to this site, so look forward to many
more updates.
