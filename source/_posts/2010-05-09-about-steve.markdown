Some of you adventurous types may have clicked the little "about" link at the
very top of the page. If you did, you quickly realized there wasn't much
there. But... change is here!  Now when you click that link you will be
redirected to Steve's new personal landing page:
[http://flavors.me/southpolesteve](http://flavors.me/southpolesteve)

I made it using this awesome site called [Flavors.Me](http://flavors.me/).  It
is a dead simple way to create an "About Me" page.  It also automatically
integrates  accounts from a ton of social media sites (Facebook, LinkedIn,
YouTube, Twitter, etc).  Highly recommended.

Happy Mother's Day!
