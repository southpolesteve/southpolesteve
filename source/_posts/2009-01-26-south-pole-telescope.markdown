[singlepic id=439 w=270 float=right] Every Sunday night at the Pole is the
"Sunday Science Lecture".  This past Sunday it was on the South Pole
Telescope.  I won't get into all the details, but they are using it to find
evidence of [dark matter](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter) and [dark
energy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy).  It was quite interesting,
and it is really cool to hear these cutting edge scientists give informal
talks about their work.  Of course, the best part was they gave everyone free
South Pole Telescope t-shirts.  Later this week I might head out to the
telescope site and see if I can get a tour.  They are located really close to
IceCube, so I might be able to do it right after work.
