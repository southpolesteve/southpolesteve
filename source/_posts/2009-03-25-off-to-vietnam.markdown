Just bought my bus ticket, leaving in one hour.  Cambodia has been insane
though!  I have really enjoyed it here.  Its quite a unique country and very
different from the others around it.

I will be in Vietnam for about 10 days and then the plan is to fly to Malaysia
for the Malaysian F1 Grand Prix.  This isn't for sure yet, but it is the
general plan.  Depends on how much I enjoy Vietnam.  Another option is just to
got to China and then the Chinese Grand Prix in Mid-April.
