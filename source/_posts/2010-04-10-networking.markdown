Building a network of contacts is one of the most important things you can do.
My friend [Jusitn Beck](http://blog.justinkbeck.com) did a great post about
this [here](http://blog.justinkbeck.com/2010/02/networking-business-of-
meeting-people.html).  I agree with pretty much everything he said.  As for
me, almost every job I have worked was a directly result of networking.  The
only job that I got without "knowing someone" was my first job - cashier at
Best Buy.

This post was inspired by what happened to me yesterday.  I went to a clean
tech presentation given by the former CEO of [Virent](http://www.virent.com/)
and the Current CEO of [ZBB batteries](http://www.zbbenergy.com), Eric
Apfelbach. After the talk, I met an [angel
investor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor) from Milwaukee and we
talked about business, entrepreneurship, and
[GeoHuddle](http://www.geohuddle.com) for almost 3 hours.  I don't know if he
will invest in [GeoHuddle](http://www.geohuddle.com) anytime soon, but he is a
great contact to have and I am sure well be talking again soon.  It would have
been so easy to leave when the presentation was over, or not to go at all.
Bottom line: Talk to EVERYONE.  You never know who might be standing right
next to you.
