[The picture page](http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3) has been updated
with pictures from Australia.  Make sure to check out the Lone Pine photos.
Handfeeding kangaroos was awesome.  Also, I have trained monkeys hard at work
on a video slideshow of Australia and New Zealand.  Hopefully they churn out
something good.
