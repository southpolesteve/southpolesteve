A couple days ago we had some interesting people arrive at the pole.  They
actually drove right up behind our drill camp.  Some other people and I had
the pleasure of welcoming them to the South Pole.

Turns out it was a team of Norwegians supporting a ski race.  The cool part
was that they were driving modified Toyota trucks and had driven them all the
way to the South Pole.
