Finally after a few hours I managed to upload pics of the bus crash

[singlepic id=1331 w=500]

The travel map has also been somewhat updated.

In other news, over the last few days I have gotten a little sick.  I have
some travel info books with me, so I'm 99% sure is a bacterial infection going
on my with my intestine.  So last night I bought antibiotics for 4 bucks from
a shady pharmacy in Cambodia.  They pretty much had every drug known to man
available over the counter.  Good news is I am feeling better already

PS :My mom is going to freak out when she reads this, and think I am dying
from a rare tropical disease  in Camboida.  Mom, I am OK.
