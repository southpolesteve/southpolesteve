What a trip already.  A 5 hour bus ride to the border, a hour at the border
getting a visa.  Then a taxi to the bus station.  Then the bus to Siem Reap
(Angkor Wat)....

Our bus driver drove the bus off the road!

We all had to get off, as the bus was literally on edge and in danger of
falling off the road entirely.  The sun then went down and we waited for over
an hour while several trucks tried to drag us out.   Quiet an intense
experience for only being in the country a few hours.  Finally though, I made
to Siem Reap but much later than expected.

I have some pics of the bus, but can't upload them yet.  Internet speeds are
glacial in Cambodia.
