On the road, I have a bit of free time. Whether on a bus, plane, or train, I
get to read a lot. So what have I been reading lately?

[singlepic id=1347 float=right w=100] The Road by Cormac McCarthy:  I read an
interview with McCarthy a few years ago, and I remember thinking he sounded
overrated and arrogant.  So I never picked up one of his books, even though he
won the Pulitzer for The Road and had No Country for Old Men turned into a
movie.  I had a change of heart in Cambodia and decided to give his Pulitzer
book a go.  It is amazing.  Tragic, but he really beautifully written.  I was
very impressed, although occasionally he likes to use words that probably only
a handful of people (and everyone who is studying for the GRE) know the
definition.  This grates on me a little.

[singlepic id=1346 float=left w=100] American Psycho by Brent Easton Ellis:  I
got this book gifted to me by a Dutch girl the day I left Cambodia.  I have
never seen the movie.  First off, the book is quite sick, twisted, and
graphic.  This book is not for the light hearted.  Second, it is awesome.  The
shallowness of all these people in this high society world is very well
portrayed.  There is a particular scene involving everyone at the table
comparing business cards, and its fantastic.  The main character is absolutely
crushed when his doesn't have the best typeface, color, thickness.  I am only
about half way through, but will probably finish in a few days because I can't
stop reading it.
