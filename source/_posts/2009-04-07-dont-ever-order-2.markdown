I just had the worst thing on the planet.  Its almost midnight here, and in
the area not much is open for food.  I wandered down to McDonald's and outside
MickeyD's was a little hamburger stand.  I couldn't read the menu, so I just
ordered what the guys standing around were having.  Here is, in order, how you
make one of these burgers:

Note: Any sauces must be added in triple portions.

1. Deep fry 2 beef patties in half an inch of oil 2. Place a large scoop of
mayo and oyster sauce on each patty 3. Fry 2 eggs in the grease, but spread it
out omelet style. 4. Stack the patties and wrap in the egg 6. Add more mayo to
the top, more oyster sauce, and chili sauce. 7. Add one thin slice of lettuce
(vegetables!) 8. Place on 2 buns that have also been drenched in mayo 9. Serve

I think it would have been a better choice to go to McDonald's
