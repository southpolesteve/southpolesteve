Some of you may have heard already, but it looks like I am headed to another
adventure.  I'm taking a job in Kuwait for the next 8 months.  I'll be working
as a design engineer for military vehicle supsensions.  They want me to leave
onl July 10th!  Basically the next 10 days will be a complete whirlwind of
packing, doctors appointments and paperwork.  It is really sudden, but I am
excited because this job is pretty much exactly what I have been looking for.

That is all the info I have for now.  I'll try and post some more later, and
of course look forward to some blogging from the Middle East.
