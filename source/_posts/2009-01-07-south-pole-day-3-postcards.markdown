Hey everyone,

First off, I am planning on sending out a bunch of postcards in the next week
or so. If you would like to recieve one, just leave your address in a comment
and I'll get one too you.

Finally after leaving on Dec. 28th, I arrived around 3pm on Jan 5th at the
South Pole. It felt like a long journey. On the way down I have been reading a
book about the first US expedition to Antarctica. They were gone for over 4
years! Its nice to think that in the event of an emergency I am only a few
plane flights away from warm weather.

Today is my first day of actual work. So far I have just been lounging around
trying to get aclimated to the altitude. The other issue here is the dry air.
Indoors, the relative humidity is roughtly 5%. Last night I put some clothes
up to dry in my room and were bone dry in about an hour. I'll give a detailed
post of the living conditions later, but its a little rough. I have to go
outside and into another building to go to the bathroom.

My shift starts at 6:30am and but its 6am here. We only get internet 9 hours a
day, so I have to get up early to check my email and post. This is definitely
an issue for me. It puts internet and sleept, two things I value highly, at
odds.

I have to go to work now, but I will give some more detailed posts soon.
Remember, if you want a post card, leave your address in the comments.
