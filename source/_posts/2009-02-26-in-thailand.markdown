Arrived in Thailand a couple nights ago. A very different country compared to
the other places I have been so far. Unfortunately I don't have internet at
the place I am staying, so updates to this site might not be too frequent. I
will do the best I can.

The plan is to stay here for at least a few weeks. I am staying with my friend
Annie who teaches English here and has a spare bed. Her place is just a 10
minute walk from a pristine beach. It is definitely pretty sweet and I am
enjoying it so far.

No real plans yet of what I will be doing here, but tomorrow I am visiting the
school with Annie and giving a lesson on the South Pole! Hopefully it goes
well. More next time!
