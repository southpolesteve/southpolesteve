In roughly 12 hours I will be leaving the South Pole.  It has been a great
time, but if I stay much longer I will be stuck here all winter.  That is not
something I am quite ready to do.  It also comes at a good time, as the
temperature has dropped about 20 F in the past day.  That means wind chills of
-65 F and less!

I'll get on a 3 hour LC-130 flight to McMurdo Station in the morning.  At
McMurdo, if everything runs smoothly, I will transfer to a C-17.  This is a
much larger cargo plane that is only used at the beginning and end of the
season.  The main advantage is that it is much faster.  The flight from
Christchurch to McMurdo took 8 hours on the way down , but the return trip
will only take 5.  It will also most likely have semi-normal airline seats
instead of jump seats.  First class Antarctic travel!  The photo below shows a
comparison between the two planes.
