I am pretty convinced that Singapore is the shopping capital of the world.
Literally mall after mall after mall. Every store you can imagine. One of the
malls had a Yamaha floor. Not a store, a floor. An entire floor devoted to
everything Yamaha - Pianos, Guitars, ATVs, Trumpets, Audio Equipment, etc.
Another mall had a bread store. A huge store that had every kind of bread,
pie, cake, bun, biscuit you can think of.

The most exciting mall for me has been the Sim Lim Square. This is a 6 story
mall of nothing but tech gadgets and electronics. Another really interesting
experience was going to the movies. This afternoon I decided to cool off in a
cinema and was suprised at a couple things. First, the movie theatres here
have extremely comfortable seats, way more comfortable than the US. Second,
your seats are reserved. You select your seat on a touch screen when you buy
the ticket and you are required to sit in that seat.

More to come as I keep exploring the city.
