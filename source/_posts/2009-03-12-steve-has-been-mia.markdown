Yes, I know, I have been neglecting the website! Apologies to everyone.
Sometimes relaxing takes priority.  I am still in Phuket, Thailand and
tonight I am flying to Bangkok.  Once I am there I will try and post all the
pictures I have taken over the past couple weeks.  In the meantime, here are
some things I have been doing:

- Went to a Muay Thai boxing match  
- Got certified as a PADI open water SCUBA diver  
- Saw sharks, eels, very poisonous fish, octopuses that change color, and dolphins while diving  
- Spent an entire day hoping between local islands and snorkeling  
- Visited several Buddhist temples  
- Went to a traditional Thai wedding and sat right next to the family!  (There were easily over 800 people there!)  
- Was blessed and given a good luck charm by a Buddhist monk  
- Taught a lesson on Antarctica to middle school Thai students  
Each of these probably deserves their own post!  At the least I hope to get
some pics up soon.   Now, I have to go pack for Bangkok and Cambodia....
