Several people posted in the comments about the food at the South Pole.  Last
night we had quite the meal here, so I thought it would be only appropriate to
post about it today.  We're going to look at three categories: The Good, The
Bad, and The Ugly.

**The Good:**  
Like I said previously, the meal last night was quite awesome.  We had king
crab legs and fillet Mignon, both of which were awesome.  Everything at the
South Pole is buffet style.  I took full advantage and ate 3 plate fulls of
what you see below.

Usually one meal of the day is pretty delicious.  Good dishes have been:
Chicken Fried Steak, Fish and Chips, Custom Omelets.

**The Bad:**  
Not all the food was as good as last night.  A common issue with having
everything buffet style is that you frequently have leftovers, especially if a
dish doesn't get eaten.  The cooks often turn the leftovers into soups, stir
fry, or salads.  We have had pizza salad, sweet and sour pork soup, "tastes
pretty good" salad, etc.  Usually these are a couple days after the main dish
is served.  The truth is that the main dishes were never good to begin with ,
so the leftover dishes leave something to be desired.

Bad meals have been: Turkey wraps (with nasty reconstituted turkey), Semi-
Rancid Bacon, Sweet and Sour Pork.

**The Ugly:**  
Through one of the drillers we have a connection to get some of the extra food
that is in storage.  Currently we have 4 cases of corn dogs stockpiled out at
our work site.  This is what I usually eat for breakfast.

The South Pole also has a large emergency food cache that they rotate every 10
years.  I happened to be here during the rotation, so I got to try some of the
food.  The most interesting item was the Bacon Bar...

This is basically a slab of deep fried bacon that is compressed and seasoned.
It looks and feels like something resembling a power bar.  It was also
packaged on June 11th, 1986.  I did try it, and it tasted pretty good!  But
I'm not gonna lie, it was a little weird eating something that was packaged
before I was born.
