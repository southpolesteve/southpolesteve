Two nights ago was the annual South Pole In-Da-Continent Film Festival.
Otherwise known as SPIFF.  They show a bunch of short films made by people
here at the station.  One of the films was very interesting, even though it
was just a simple interview.

Earlier this season a skier arrived at the pole nearly about to collapse from
exhaustion.  He started cross country skiing from the edge of the continent,
but broke his ski binding on the 4th day in.  Instead of turning around he
decided to keep going - to walk to the pole.  He ended up making it on Dec.
23rd and in the process broke the world record for walking to the South Pole.

The video shown at SPIFF was an interview taken soon after he arrived at the
station.  I found it very interesting.  He is still extremely in touch with
all of the emotions associated with his trip and it was really cool to hear
him talk about what he went through when it was still so fresh in his mind.

IceCube has been kind enough to post it on their website
[here](http://icecube.wisc.edu/~krasberg/pictures/Spiff-MarkKandShelbyH.mov).
I recommend checking it out if you get the chance.  A warning though, the file
is over 2 GB in size.  It may take a while to download, so be aware.
