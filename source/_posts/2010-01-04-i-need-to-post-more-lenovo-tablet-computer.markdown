I realized that I have been neglecting this blog lately.  I guess since I'm
not half way across the world I kind of forgot about it.  Since my life has
become a little more normal, I figured I would start posting more often, and
posting about more traditional things. Life, TV shows, Politics, Tech, etc.
So here it goes!

I just wanted to direct you to this post:

Very cool!  Some of you might be aware that Apple is heavily rumored to be
releasing a tablet computer sometime at the end of January.  This product by
Lenovo is way cooler.  It is a tablet that I might actually use.
