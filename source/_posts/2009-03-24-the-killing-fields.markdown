Today I went to two very intense places around Phnom Phen. The [Tuol Sleng
Prison](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng) and the [Choeung
Ek](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choeung_Ek) killing fields. Quite an
harrowing experience. To see the hundreds of skulls stacked in the stupa at
Choeung Ek was particularly chilling sight. With the internet speeds here I
can't post any pictures yet, but I highly recommend clicking through to the
links and learning a little more. The Khmer Rouge only ran Cambodia for 4
years, but over 1.5 million people died during that time. It is not something
we hear about too much in the US.
