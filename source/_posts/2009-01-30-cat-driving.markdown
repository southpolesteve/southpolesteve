Yesterday we didn't have much to do in the afternoon, so I got to learn how to
drive the Caterpillar 287 and 953.  The 287 is the smaller bobcat-style
vehicle on the left, and the 953 is the large fork loader on the right.  They
really aren't hard to use when you get a little practice.  The 287 is a lot of
fun.  I need to figure out how to get one for home.
