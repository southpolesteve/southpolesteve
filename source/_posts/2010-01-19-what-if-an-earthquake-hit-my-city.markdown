After seeing some of the horrific images coming out of Haiti, I started asking
myself this question. Actually, the first question I asked was, "How do I get
on a plane to Haiti?" After some research, it turns out experience is usually
required before they will put you on a plane and air drop you into a disaster
relief effort. Then I found myself wondering what I could do the next time
something like this happens. It turns out there is a great book that answers a
lot of these questions!

I read [Emergency: This Book Will Save Your Life](http://www.amazon.com/gp/pro
duct/0060898771?ie=UTF8&tag=soupolste-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&
creativeASIN=0060898771)![](http://www.assoc-
amazon.com/e/ir?t=soupolste-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0060898771) by Neil Strauss earlier
this year and its a great resource for anyone looking for more information
about what to do when all hell breaks loose. In the book, Niel highlights
Community Emergency Responder Training (CERT). CERT was developed by the Los
Angeles disaster management office and now is used by FEMA to train local
emergency responders all over the country. My friend Will and I are now signed
up for the local CERT class over the next two weekends. I'm really excited
about this and I'll have to do a post about how it goes. I might be a long way
from drop shipping to a international disaster relief effort, but at least it
is a first step. If you have a couple free Saturdays and are interested in
finding out about how you can register for CERT [click
