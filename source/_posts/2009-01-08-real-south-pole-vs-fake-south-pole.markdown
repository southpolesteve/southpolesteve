Several people asked me before I left:

_"Is there really a red and white pole at the South Pole?" _

The answer is yes....and no.  Lets explore a little deeper and look at some
pictures.

**The "Ceremonial"  South Pole:** These are some pictures from the ceremonial south pole. As you can see it is red and white striped. This is like the touristy spot, where all the hip people get there picture taken. But is it really at the South Pole? Not quite.... [singlepic id=374 w=380] [singlepic id=376 w=380]  
**The "Real" South Pole:** Below are some pictures of the real south pole. It is about 50 ft from the ceremonial pole. Why? Here a the pole we are on a huge ice sheet, several thousand meters deep. Most of Antarctica is essentially one massive glacier and like any glacier, it moves. In this case about 10 meters a year. So every year they have to move the marker for the real south pole, but the ceremonial pole stays in place, moving farther and farther away. [singlepic id=379 w=380] [singlepic id=378 w=380]
