Early this morning I got a call from Raytheon. I went to get fitted for all my
gear today, instead of tomorrow. Looks like there will be some weather issues
with leaving on Jan. 3rd so I have been bumped up to leave on the 2nd. That
means about 9am tomorrow I will be headed down to McMurdo Station.

McMurdo is on the coast of Antarctica and is the major base for the United
States Antarctic Program (USAP). Over a 1000 people are stationed there this
time of year. I should only be at McMurdo for a few days, but it will still be
exciting. There are several labs to tour and I might even see some penguins.
