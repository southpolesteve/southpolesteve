It's about 3AM here. Luckily I don't have to start work tomorrow, so I can
adjust to the time change.  It is extremely hot, about 110 F when I got off
the plane.  The air also tastes kind of like burning oil.  Just stand in front
of your car exhaust for a while, and that's exactly what it feels like in
Kuwait.

The new apartments they have for us are really nice.  Definitely a sweet
setup.  Right next door is the "Chicken King" where I ate my first meal in
Kuwait.  An entire rotisserie chicken, flatbread, hummus, and yogurt all for
$5.  Not a bad deal.

More details to come.  I need to try and get some more sleep.  It looks like
initially we will be working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week!  Better rest up...
