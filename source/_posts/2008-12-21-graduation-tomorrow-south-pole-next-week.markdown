Thanks to everyone that has subscribed over the last week or so. The site is
almost completely up and running. Just a few more bugs to work out. There will
be some cool new features as well. One of which will be a page with a Google
map that shows every place I have been in my journey.

Hopefully starting later this week I will get to start posting on a daily
basis about my experiences. If there is something you want me to talk about,
just leave a comment. In a few weeks I will try and write a couple of posts on
the science behind IceCube and what we are actually doing at the South Pole.

In the meantime, I am graduating college tomorrow. Those of you who have
talked to me over the last couple of days know it was a little touch and go
near the end, but everything has been worked out and I will actually be
graduating tomorrow. After graduation I am going back to Boston until I leave
for New Zealand on Dec. 28th. Look forward to more posts soon!
