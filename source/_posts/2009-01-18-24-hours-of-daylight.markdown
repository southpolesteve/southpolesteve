During this time of year, the South Pole summer, there is 24 hours of
daylight.  The sun just stays at a constant angle and rotates around your
head.  At first I thought this was cool. There is no bad time of day to do
anything.  Take pictures, work, visit the pole.  As long as you are awake it
doesn't matter.

Now, it is starting to get on my nerves a little.  The body's circadian rhythm
is hard to trick.  After being here for a couple weeks my body is starting to
wonder why it isn't getting dark.  Often I will spend a couple hours at night
inside the station watching a movie.  My brain knows that it was light when I
went inside. Since it is late in the day, my mind expects it to be dark when I
go back outside.  When I walk back to my hut and it is bright as midday, I get
a slight sense of confusion.  I don't know of a better way to explain it.

Definitely looking forward to seeing the night sky again....
