I just wanted to post a picture of this. The bathroom in the guest house I am
staying at is ridiculously small. The picture was taken standing outside of
the bathroom. Also, you can barely see it but there is a shower spigot on the
left side of the wall. To take a shower I sit in the sink.... [singlepic
