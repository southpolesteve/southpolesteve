Its been a little while since my last update.  Not much new to report.  Kuwait
is still hot, and still one gigantic desert.  I am really looking forward to
getting back to the states and seeing some grass and trees.  I have less than
2 weeks left here, but the days are moving ultra slow.  We are having some
issues at work that are slowing the whole operation down.  Also, even though
we are inside, it still gets to 95 deg in the afternoon.  Not the makings of
an enjoyable 12 hour day.

I don't have a flight home yet, but I should know in the next couple days
exactly when I am coming back.  First stop will be in Madison, and then it is
out to California for my cousin Cade's wedding.

Looking forward to feeling some cool wind off the bay.  Anyone know someone I
can go sailing with out in California?
