As some of you might know, I am probably going to move to Iceland next
February.  I'll be studying [geothermal
energy](http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Geothermal_energy) at the [Renewable
Energy School](http://www.res.is/) which is a private school that works in
combination with the [University of
Iceland](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iceland) and the
[University of Akureyri](http://english.unak.is/).  More details will come as
Febrauary gets closer.

Right now, I just want to assure everyone (mostly my mom) that I won't end up
in the path of the recent volcanic eruptions.  Akureyri is almost 150 miles
from the eruption site and on the other side of the island.  See the map:
