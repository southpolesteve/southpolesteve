Yesterday we had a distinguished guest at the South Pole. The Prince of Monaco
came to visit the station and gave a short speech. He is on a tour of 26
Antarctic stations promoting environmentalism and Monaco recent signing of the
Antarctic Treaty. In honor of the Prince's visit I thought I would talk a
little about people who visit the pole.

Every year there are some private flights that are chartered to the South Pole
and the always fill up. You can sign up through a company known as
[ALE](http://www.antarctic-logistics.com/programs_b.html),Â  but it is quite
expensive. Roughly $38,000 to visit the pole.

Last week we had an ALE fight come in with some interesting people. One was a
rich guy from Alabama that bought half of of the station's store out. Another
was a very old lady, probably over 80. Apparently she had to be on oxygen the
entire time and almost collapsed walking back to the plane.

There are also guests hosted by the NSF. The Prince of Monaco was one of them.
On my flight to the pole was the former president of Slovakia. I really don't
know why he was here, or what interest he had in Antarctica.

Next week there is a group from the House Committee on Commerce, Justice, and
Science. I don't know if any congressmen are in the group, but I will
definitely keep you all updated.
