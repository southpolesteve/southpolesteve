[singlepic id=486 w=280 float=right]Today was by far the coldest day since I
have been here. Only about -25 F, but the wind was over 25 mph all morning
resulting in -55 F wind chills and lower. Of course it came at the worst
possible time. Today was the day that we moved the drill camp, so we spent
almost all of it outside. Later in the morning it was blowing so much snow
that we couldn’t see the station any more, and drill camp is only about ¼ mile
away.

[singlepic id=477  w=280 float=right] Moving camp involved brining in the big
dozers and towing the building to the new location. We can tow up to 5 at
once. The first dozer got stuck in a patch of really soft snow. We had to call
in another bigger dozer to pull out the small dozer and all 5 buildings….at
the same time. It was a pretty impressive sight.

The day was mostly spent hooking and unhooking tow hitches and chains. You can
probably see why the weather was so harsh on our team. Frequently my baklava
would freeze to a part of my face and I would have to rip it off. In addition
my goggles kept fogging up on both the inside and the outside. The fog turns
to ice nearly instantly, so you can’t just wipe it off. You have to jump in
the van to warm them up, or try and scrape the ice off. Pretty soon, I just
gave up and spent most of the day looking through a hazy ice layer and trying
not to run into things or crash snowmobiles.

Hoping that today is better weather…
