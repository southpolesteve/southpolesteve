  <div class="entry_content"><p>[singlepic id=925 w=250 float=right] Here it is. The road trip post!  A quick
rundown of my week driving all over New Zealand&#8217;s south island.  The pictures
are all posted on the <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3">pictures
page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Feb 9th - Christchurch to Oamaru:</strong><br/>
Mike and I rented a car from a very cute little punk rock chick in downtown
Christchurch.  Left in the afternoon and headed down to Oamaru.  On the way we
stopped in Raikia Gorge to snap some photos.  In Oamaru we just made it in
time to see the penguins come out.  We went down to observation point, but it
was quite difficult to see them as we were high up on the cliffs.  That night
we stayed in a little shack of a hostel, but it was run by some very nice
people.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2 - Feb 10th - Oamaru to Te Anau:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=888 w=250 float=right] Most of the morning was spent driving
down the coast past Dunedin, then we turned inland.  The low hills are quite
pretty in New Zealand, and there are sheep and cows everywhere.  That night we
got to Te Anau and hopped on a sunset cruise and tour of the glow worm caves.
The caves are quite amazing.  It is just what it sounds like, thousands of
tiny glow worms light up thecave with small blue lights.  The highlight is the
last room of the cave where it actually feels like looking at a starry sky
rather than the ceiling of a cave.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3 - Feb 11th - Te Anau to Wanaka:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=579 w=250 float=right] We had to wake up around 5am to drive to
Milford Sound - the highlight of the trip.  The drive takes a couple hours
through stunning valleys, fiords, and lakes.  Then we took a two hour cruise
of the sound.  I took nearly <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3&amp;album=2&amp;gallery=13">300
picutres</a> while
we were there.  Definitely check them out, but they don&#8217;t really do the
scenery justice.  On the way out we stopped and hiked up to a waterfall coming
off a high glacier.  We found out later that it was off limits.  Whoops.  That
afternoon we drove back to Te Anau and then all the way to Wanaka, a small
town up by a mountain lake.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4 - Feb 12th - Wanaka to Hanmer Springs:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=958 w=250 float=right] Probably our longest day of driving.  In
the morning we drove to the west coast and stopped at Fox glacier.  We hiked
up to the observation point, which was quite far away from the face of the
glacier.  There were all kinds of signs warning of dangerous slides, ice
falls, rocks, and surging water past that point.  We promptly ignored the
signs and went right up to the face and the river coming from the glacier.
That afternoon we drove all the way to Hanmer Springs and crashed for the
night.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5 - Feb 13th - Hanmer Springs to Christchurch :</strong><br/>
The morning in Hanmer Springs was spent soaking in hot pools and sulfer pools.
Very relaxing, all though they stretched the idea of &#8220;natural&#8221; a bit.  Mid day
we drove back down to Christchurch to meet some friends of my dad - Nigel and
Wendy Gilchrist.  They invited us to join them for a fantastic dinner party
with fresh scallops, lobster and whitebait.</p>

<p><strong>Day 6 - Feb 14th - In Christchurch :</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=968 w=250 float=right] Mike left back for the states in the
morning.  In the late afternoon Nigel took me to my first professional rugby
match.  It was very exciting and I think I finally have a handle on how the
game is played.</p>

<p><strong>Day 7 - Feb 15th - To Brisbane, Australia:</strong><br/>
Today is day 7.  I am leaving this afternoon for 5 days in Brisbane,
Australia.  Then on Feb 20th I am headed to Singapore.  It has been a great
time in New Zealand.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to post about a tenth of the
experiences I have had here, but I am looking forward to more in other
countries!</p>
