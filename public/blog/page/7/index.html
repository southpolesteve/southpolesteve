  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=925 w=250 float=right] Here it is. The road trip post!  A quick
rundown of my week driving all over New Zealand&#8217;s south island.  The pictures
are all posted on the <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3">pictures
page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Feb 9th - Christchurch to Oamaru:</strong><br/>
Mike and I rented a car from a very cute little punk rock chick in downtown
Christchurch.  Left in the afternoon and headed down to Oamaru.  On the way we
stopped in Raikia Gorge to snap some photos.  In Oamaru we just made it in
time to see the penguins come out.  We went down to observation point, but it
was quite difficult to see them as we were high up on the cliffs.  That night
we stayed in a little shack of a hostel, but it was run by some very nice
people.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2 - Feb 10th - Oamaru to Te Anau:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=888 w=250 float=right] Most of the morning was spent driving
down the coast past Dunedin, then we turned inland.  The low hills are quite
pretty in New Zealand, and there are sheep and cows everywhere.  That night we
got to Te Anau and hopped on a sunset cruise and tour of the glow worm caves.
The caves are quite amazing.  It is just what it sounds like, thousands of
tiny glow worms light up thecave with small blue lights.  The highlight is the
last room of the cave where it actually feels like looking at a starry sky
rather than the ceiling of a cave.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3 - Feb 11th - Te Anau to Wanaka:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=579 w=250 float=right] We had to wake up around 5am to drive to
Milford Sound - the highlight of the trip.  The drive takes a couple hours
through stunning valleys, fiords, and lakes.  Then we took a two hour cruise
of the sound.  I took nearly <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3&amp;album=2&amp;gallery=13">300
picutres</a> while
we were there.  Definitely check them out, but they don&#8217;t really do the
scenery justice.  On the way out we stopped and hiked up to a waterfall coming
off a high glacier.  We found out later that it was off limits.  Whoops.  That
afternoon we drove back to Te Anau and then all the way to Wanaka, a small
town up by a mountain lake.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4 - Feb 12th - Wanaka to Hanmer Springs:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=958 w=250 float=right] Probably our longest day of driving.  In
the morning we drove to the west coast and stopped at Fox glacier.  We hiked
up to the observation point, which was quite far away from the face of the
glacier.  There were all kinds of signs warning of dangerous slides, ice
falls, rocks, and surging water past that point.  We promptly ignored the
signs and went right up to the face and the river coming from the glacier.
That afternoon we drove all the way to Hanmer Springs and crashed for the
night.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5 - Feb 13th - Hanmer Springs to Christchurch :</strong><br/>
The morning in Hanmer Springs was spent soaking in hot pools and sulfer pools.
Very relaxing, all though they stretched the idea of &#8220;natural&#8221; a bit.  Mid day
we drove back down to Christchurch to meet some friends of my dad - Nigel and
Wendy Gilchrist.  They invited us to join them for a fantastic dinner party
with fresh scallops, lobster and whitebait.</p>

<p><strong>Day 6 - Feb 14th - In Christchurch :</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=968 w=250 float=right] Mike left back for the states in the
morning.  In the late afternoon Nigel took me to my first professional rugby
match.  It was very exciting and I think I finally have a handle on how the
game is played.</p>

<p><strong>Day 7 - Feb 15th - To Brisbane, Australia:</strong><br/>
Today is day 7.  I am leaving this afternoon for 5 days in Brisbane,
Australia.  Then on Feb 20th I am headed to Singapore.  It has been a great
time in New Zealand.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to post about a tenth of the
experiences I have had here, but I am looking forward to more in other
countries!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey, sorry for no updates, but I have been on the road in New Zealand and
staying in places with little or no internet. No time to post either. We have
covered over 2000km in about 3.5 days, so been busy driving. I will try and
get a detailed update soon and post a few hundred pictures. I have also
finalized plans for leaving New Zealand. I am flying to Brisbane, Australia on
Feb 15th and to Singapore on Feb 20th. That&#8217;s all I have time for right now.
More to come soon!</p>

<p>PS, the travel map has been updated:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=525 w=200 float=right] Today, some drillers and I took a day
trip out to the Banks Peninsula and the town of Akaroa. It is a small touristy
village with boat cruises, sea kayaking, and whale watching. We mostly just
bummed around town all afternoon and then headed back tonight. While we were
in town they had a pretty neat airshow. This was apparently related to the
national holiday that was yesterday - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi_Day">Waitangi
Day</a>. The country side was also
quite beautiful so you will have to check out some of the pictures in the
album.  Reminds me a lot of the costal hills in California combined with a
seaside Oregon town.  Also, lots of sheep were present.  Fact: There are more
sheep than people in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Edit: Whoops, I had that fact turned around before</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arrived back in New Zealand last night at around 9pm.  Very glad to be back in
warm weather.  Not much of an update today, need to recharge my batteries, but
a quick list of important things:</p>

<li>I can use Skype again!  My user name is southpolesteve.  Hit me up anytime I am online.  There is a online status indicator on the side of the website and here:</li>
<li>There will be a few more posts on Antarctica to cover some things I didn&#8217;t get to while I was down there.</li>
<li>No more walking outside to go to the bathroom!</li>
<li>Travel map has been updated

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In roughly 12 hours I will be leaving the South Pole.  It has been a great
time, but if I stay much longer I will be stuck here all winter.  That is not
something I am quite ready to do.  It also comes at a good time, as the
temperature has dropped about 20 F in the past day.  That means wind chills of
-65 F and less!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get on a 3 hour LC-130 flight to McMurdo Station in the morning.  At
McMurdo, if everything runs smoothly, I will transfer to a C-17.  This is a
much larger cargo plane that is only used at the beginning and end of the
season.  The main advantage is that it is much faster.  The flight from
Christchurch to McMurdo took 8 hours on the way down , but the return trip
will only take 5.  It will also most likely have semi-normal airline seats
instead of jump seats.  First class Antarctic travel!  The photo below shows a
comparison between the two planes.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=509 w=250 float=right]There is a pretty cool atmospheric
phenomon here called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog">sun dogs</a>.  They
are false images of the sun that are caused by light being bent by ice
crystals in the upper atmosphere.  Sun dogs are similar to rainbows, but are
created by ice crystals instead of water droplets.  These occur all over the
world, but they are the brightest at extremely cold temperatures - South Pole
sounds like a pefect place.  They were much more prevelent earlier in the
season because the sun was closer to to the ideal angle.  The picture at the
left shows the sun blocked out.  You can see one sun dog and the two halos
that are also often visible.  On extremely clear days its not uncommon to see
three complete halos around the sun, two sun dogs nearly as bright as the sun,
and one halo that goes all the way around your head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick post unrelated to South Pole adventures.</p>

<p>I have just installed a new comment system on the site.  It should have a lot
more features than the previous one.  One of the cool features is that you can
respond to other people&#8217;s comments.  Next to every comment there is a reply
link.  Just click on that and type away.  This also means that I can start
responding to your comments directly.  Also, if you want to get notified by
email if someone responds to your comment, there is a check box when you post
that will do that.</p>

<p>Hope everyone enjoys it!  If something isn&#8217;t working right, just let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=503 w=250 float=right]A common question people ask:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;What are you doing after you leave the South Pole?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The answer: Traveling the world!</p>

<p>The initial plan is to spend some time in New Zealand. IceCube pays for 4
nights of hotel in Christchurch, so I will definitely take advantage of that.
On Feb 9th it is looking like I will head up to the mountains with a few other
drillers. We will be taking a helicopter up to a remote cabin in the middle of
the Southern Alps. Here is a map of its location and above is a picture from
the air.  If you click on either picture, you should be able to see a bigger
version.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=507 w=525]</p>

<p>After the trip to the mountains things are still in limbo.  The general plan
is to fly to Brisbane, Australia to visit my friend Jack who is studying
abroad.  Then fly to Singapore, take a train/bus to Phuket, Thailand to visit
my friend Annie.  The train and bus system in SE Asia is very cheap, so I hope
to travel around to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China if I can get a visa.
After that, who knows?</p>

<p>Of course if anyone wants to come join me in SE Asia there is an open
invitation.  Getting there can be expensive from the US, but staying there is
extremely cheap.</p>

<p>Along the way I will continue posting to this site, so look forward to many
more updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we didn&#8217;t have much to do in the afternoon, so I got to learn how to
drive the Caterpillar 287 and 953.  The 287 is the smaller bobcat-style
vehicle on the left, and the 953 is the large fork loader on the right.  They
really aren&#8217;t hard to use when you get a little practice.  The 287 is a lot of
fun.  I need to figure out how to get one for home.</p>
