  <div class="entry-content"><p>In roughly 12 hours I will be leaving the South Pole.  It has been a great
time, but if I stay much longer I will be stuck here all winter.  That is not
something I am quite ready to do.  It also comes at a good time, as the
temperature has dropped about 20 F in the past day.  That means wind chills of
-65 F and less!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get on a 3 hour LC-130 flight to McMurdo Station in the morning.  At
McMurdo, if everything runs smoothly, I will transfer to a C-17.  This is a
much larger cargo plane that is only used at the beginning and end of the
season.  The main advantage is that it is much faster.  The flight from
Christchurch to McMurdo took 8 hours on the way down , but the return trip
will only take 5.  It will also most likely have semi-normal airline seats
instead of jump seats.  First class Antarctic travel!  The photo below shows a
comparison between the two planes.</p>

October for a HUGE adventure.  She is participating in a world-wide missionary

doing service missionary work in 11 countries in 11 months!  I think she
deserves some recognition for taking almost an entire year off for such a good

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=509 w=250 float=right]There is a pretty cool atmospheric
phenomon here called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog">sun dogs</a>.  They
are false images of the sun that are caused by light being bent by ice
crystals in the upper atmosphere.  Sun dogs are similar to rainbows, but are
created by ice crystals instead of water droplets.  These occur all over the
world, but they are the brightest at extremely cold temperatures - South Pole
sounds like a pefect place.  They were much more prevelent earlier in the
season because the sun was closer to to the ideal angle.  The picture at the
left shows the sun blocked out.  You can see one sun dog and the two halos
that are also often visible.  On extremely clear days its not uncommon to see
three complete halos around the sun, two sun dogs nearly as bright as the sun,
and one halo that goes all the way around your head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick post unrelated to South Pole adventures.</p>

<p>I have just installed a new comment system on the site.  It should have a lot
more features than the previous one.  One of the cool features is that you can
respond to other people&#8217;s comments.  Next to every comment there is a reply
link.  Just click on that and type away.  This also means that I can start
responding to your comments directly.  Also, if you want to get notified by
email if someone responds to your comment, there is a check box when you post
that will do that.</p>

<p>Hope everyone enjoys it!  If something isn&#8217;t working right, just let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=503 w=250 float=right]A common question people ask:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;What are you doing after you leave the South Pole?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The answer: Traveling the world!</p>

<p>The initial plan is to spend some time in New Zealand. IceCube pays for 4
nights of hotel in Christchurch, so I will definitely take advantage of that.
On Feb 9th it is looking like I will head up to the mountains with a few other
drillers. We will be taking a helicopter up to a remote cabin in the middle of
the Southern Alps. Here is a map of its location and above is a picture from
the air.  If you click on either picture, you should be able to see a bigger
version.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=507 w=525]</p>

<p>After the trip to the mountains things are still in limbo.  The general plan
is to fly to Brisbane, Australia to visit my friend Jack who is studying
abroad.  Then fly to Singapore, take a train/bus to Phuket, Thailand to visit
my friend Annie.  The train and bus system in SE Asia is very cheap, so I hope
to travel around to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China if I can get a visa.
After that, who knows?</p>

<p>Of course if anyone wants to come join me in SE Asia there is an open
invitation.  Getting there can be expensive from the US, but staying there is
extremely cheap.</p>

<p>Along the way I will continue posting to this site, so look forward to many
more updates.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we didn&#8217;t have much to do in the afternoon, so I got to learn how to
drive the Caterpillar 287 and 953.  The 287 is the smaller bobcat-style
vehicle on the left, and the 953 is the large fork loader on the right.  They
really aren&#8217;t hard to use when you get a little practice.  The 287 is a lot of
fun.  I need to figure out how to get one for home.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=486 w=280 float=right]Today was by far the coldest day since I
have been here. Only about -25 F, but the wind was over 25 mph all morning
resulting in -55 F wind chills and lower. Of course it came at the worst
possible time. Today was the day that we moved the drill camp, so we spent
almost all of it outside. Later in the morning it was blowing so much snow
that we couldn’t see the station any more, and drill camp is only about ¼ mile
away.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=477  w=280 float=right] Moving camp involved brining in the big
dozers and towing the building to the new location. We can tow up to 5 at
once. The first dozer got stuck in a patch of really soft snow. We had to call
in another bigger dozer to pull out the small dozer and all 5 buildings….at
the same time. It was a pretty impressive sight.</p>

<p>The day was mostly spent hooking and unhooking tow hitches and chains. You can
probably see why the weather was so harsh on our team. Frequently my baklava
would freeze to a part of my face and I would have to rip it off. In addition
my goggles kept fogging up on both the inside and the outside. The fog turns
to ice nearly instantly, so you can’t just wipe it off. You have to jump in
the van to warm them up, or try and scrape the ice off. Pretty soon, I just
gave up and spent most of the day looking through a hazy ice layer and trying
not to run into things or crash snowmobiles.</p>

<p>Hoping that today is better weather…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I wanted to post some pictures of what we do for fun here at the Pole.
Not much time before work this morning, so I  will be brief.</p>

<p>Here is where we eat.  The Galley.  Food is all served buffet style.  For more
on the food, see my previous post
<a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?p=115">here</a>.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=440 w=400]</p>

<p>The station also has a grow room for fresh vegetables.  I usually go here to
make telephone calls.  It is quiet, there is a couch, and best of all it has a
normal humidity</p>

<p>[singlepic id=446 w=400]</p>

<p>There are two lounges on station where we watch movies and can play video
games.  The station has  a pretty imense library of DVD&#8217;s, VHS, and even
BetaMax.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=447 w=400]</p>

<p>One of the lounges also has a pool table</p>

<p>[singlepic id=450 w=400]</p>

<p>There is an arts and crafts room.  I haven&#8217;t made it in there very much.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=452 w=400]</p>

<p>Twice a week I play some basketball in the Gym.  Playing basketball at 10,000
ft is quite exhausting.  The dry air also makes it difficult to breathe.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=453 w=400]</p>

<p>The last room rec room is a music room.  They have some pretty nice music
gear.  Several <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product%0A/Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar?sku=515748">Fender American</a> guitars and
a <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Gibson-SG-Standard-%0AElectric-Guitar?sku=517265">Gibson SG</a>.  They even have two carbon fiber<a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navigation/guitars?N=100001+304262&amp;Ntt=R%0Aainsong&amp;src=3WWRWXO1&amp;ZYXSEM=0"> acoustic guitar
s</a>.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=454 w=400]</p>

<p>But, even with all the stuff to do, the drill crew spends a lot of time just
sitting around, talking, and drinking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=439 w=270 float=right] Every Sunday night at the Pole is the
&#8220;Sunday Science Lecture&#8221;.  This past Sunday it was on the South Pole
Telescope.  I won&#8217;t get into all the details, but they are using it to find
evidence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy">dark
energy</a>.  It was quite interesting,
and it is really cool to hear these cutting edge scientists give informal
talks about their work.  Of course, the best part was they gave everyone free
South Pole Telescope t-shirts.  Later this week I might head out to the
telescope site and see if I can get a tour.  They are located really close to
IceCube, so I might be able to do it right after work.</p>
