  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=509 w=250 float=right]There is a pretty cool atmospheric
phenomon here called <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_dog">sun dogs</a>.  They
are false images of the sun that are caused by light being bent by ice
crystals in the upper atmosphere.  Sun dogs are similar to rainbows, but are
created by ice crystals instead of water droplets.  These occur all over the
world, but they are the brightest at extremely cold temperatures - South Pole
sounds like a pefect place.  They were much more prevelent earlier in the
season because the sun was closer to to the ideal angle.  The picture at the
left shows the sun blocked out.  You can see one sun dog and the two halos
that are also often visible.  On extremely clear days its not uncommon to see
three complete halos around the sun, two sun dogs nearly as bright as the sun,
and one halo that goes all the way around your head.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quick post unrelated to South Pole adventures.</p>

<p>I have just installed a new comment system on the site.  It should have a lot
more features than the previous one.  One of the cool features is that you can
respond to other people&#8217;s comments.  Next to every comment there is a reply
link.  Just click on that and type away.  This also means that I can start
responding to your comments directly.  Also, if you want to get notified by
email if someone responds to your comment, there is a check box when you post
that will do that.</p>

<p>Hope everyone enjoys it!  If something isn&#8217;t working right, just let me know.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=503 w=250 float=right]A common question people ask:</p>

<p><em>&#8220;What are you doing after you leave the South Pole?&#8221;</em></p>

<p>The answer: Traveling the world!</p>

<p>The initial plan is to spend some time in New Zealand. IceCube pays for 4
nights of hotel in Christchurch, so I will definitely take advantage of that.
On Feb 9th it is looking like I will head up to the mountains with a few other
drillers. We will be taking a helicopter up to a remote cabin in the middle of
the Southern Alps. Here is a map of its location and above is a picture from
the air.  If you click on either picture, you should be able to see a bigger
version.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=507 w=525]</p>

<p>After the trip to the mountains things are still in limbo.  The general plan
is to fly to Brisbane, Australia to visit my friend Jack who is studying
abroad.  Then fly to Singapore, take a train/bus to Phuket, Thailand to visit
my friend Annie.  The train and bus system in SE Asia is very cheap, so I hope
to travel around to Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam and China if I can get a visa.
After that, who knows?</p>

<p>Of course if anyone wants to come join me in SE Asia there is an open
invitation.  Getting there can be expensive from the US, but staying there is
extremely cheap.</p>

<p>Along the way I will continue posting to this site, so look forward to many
more updates.</p>

really aren&#8217;t hard to use when you get a little practice.  The 287 is a lot of

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=486 w=280 float=right]Today was by far the coldest day since I
have been here. Only about -25 F, but the wind was over 25 mph all morning
resulting in -55 F wind chills and lower. Of course it came at the worst
possible time. Today was the day that we moved the drill camp, so we spent
almost all of it outside. Later in the morning it was blowing so much snow
that we couldn’t see the station any more, and drill camp is only about ¼ mile
away.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=477  w=280 float=right] Moving camp involved brining in the big
dozers and towing the building to the new location. We can tow up to 5 at
once. The first dozer got stuck in a patch of really soft snow. We had to call
in another bigger dozer to pull out the small dozer and all 5 buildings….at
the same time. It was a pretty impressive sight.</p>

<p>The day was mostly spent hooking and unhooking tow hitches and chains. You can
probably see why the weather was so harsh on our team. Frequently my baklava
would freeze to a part of my face and I would have to rip it off. In addition
my goggles kept fogging up on both the inside and the outside. The fog turns
to ice nearly instantly, so you can’t just wipe it off. You have to jump in
the van to warm them up, or try and scrape the ice off. Pretty soon, I just
gave up and spent most of the day looking through a hazy ice layer and trying
not to run into things or crash snowmobiles.</p>

<p>Hoping that today is better weather…</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I wanted to post some pictures of what we do for fun here at the Pole.
Not much time before work this morning, so I  will be brief.</p>

<p>Here is where we eat.  The Galley.  Food is all served buffet style.  For more
on the food, see my previous post
<a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?p=115">here</a>.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=440 w=400]</p>

<p>The station also has a grow room for fresh vegetables.  I usually go here to
make telephone calls.  It is quiet, there is a couch, and best of all it has a
normal humidity</p>

<p>[singlepic id=446 w=400]</p>

<p>There are two lounges on station where we watch movies and can play video
games.  The station has  a pretty imense library of DVD&#8217;s, VHS, and even
BetaMax.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=447 w=400]</p>

<p>One of the lounges also has a pool table</p>

<p>[singlepic id=450 w=400]</p>

<p>There is an arts and crafts room.  I haven&#8217;t made it in there very much.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=452 w=400]</p>

<p>Twice a week I play some basketball in the Gym.  Playing basketball at 10,000
ft is quite exhausting.  The dry air also makes it difficult to breathe.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=453 w=400]</p>

<p>The last room rec room is a music room.  They have some pretty nice music
gear.  Several <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product%0A/Fender-American-Standard-Stratocaster-Electric-Guitar?sku=515748">Fender American</a> guitars and
a <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/product/Gibson-SG-Standard-%0AElectric-Guitar?sku=517265">Gibson SG</a>.  They even have two carbon fiber<a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/navigation/guitars?N=100001+304262&amp;Ntt=R%0Aainsong&amp;src=3WWRWXO1&amp;ZYXSEM=0"> acoustic guitar
s</a>.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=454 w=400]</p>

<p>But, even with all the stuff to do, the drill crew spends a lot of time just
sitting around, talking, and drinking.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=439 w=270 float=right] Every Sunday night at the Pole is the
&#8220;Sunday Science Lecture&#8221;.  This past Sunday it was on the South Pole
Telescope.  I won&#8217;t get into all the details, but they are using it to find
evidence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy">dark
energy</a>.  It was quite interesting,
and it is really cool to hear these cutting edge scientists give informal
talks about their work.  Of course, the best part was they gave everyone free
South Pole Telescope t-shirts.  Later this week I might head out to the
telescope site and see if I can get a tour.  They are located really close to
IceCube, so I might be able to do it right after work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two nights ago was the annual South Pole In-Da-Continent Film Festival.
Otherwise known as SPIFF.  They show a bunch of short films made by people
here at the station.  One of the films was very interesting, even though it
was just a simple interview.</p>

<p>Earlier this season a skier arrived at the pole nearly about to collapse from
exhaustion.  He started cross country skiing from the edge of the continent,
but broke his ski binding on the 4th day in.  Instead of turning around he
decided to keep going - to walk to the pole.  He ended up making it on Dec.
23rd and in the process broke the world record for walking to the South Pole.</p>

<p>The video shown at SPIFF was an interview taken soon after he arrived at the
station.  I found it very interesting.  He is still extremely in touch with
all of the emotions associated with his trip and it was really cool to hear
him talk about what he went through when it was still so fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>IceCube has been kind enough to post it on their website
<a href="http://icecube.wisc.edu/~krasberg/pictures/Spiff-MarkKandShelbyH.mov">here</a>.
I recommend checking it out if you get the chance.  A warning though, the file
is over 2 GB in size.  It may take a while to download, so be aware.</p>

      </p>
    
  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=417 w=200 float=right] First off, I should apologize.  I haven&#8217;t
done a post on work yet, and for the most part there isn&#8217;t much left.  Some of
you might not know that I work for the <a href="http://www.icecube.wisc.edu">IceCube</a>
project.  I have linked to their website, so if you want to know more about
the science, check it out.  I will try and do a post on the science behind the
project a little later, but it can get pretty complicated.</p>

<p>What you should know is that my job mostly revolves around drilling extremely
large holes.  Holes in the ice sheet that are roughly 2500m deep and 0.5m
wide.  To make these holes, we heat water up to 190 F and pressurize it to
1000 PSI.  Then we pump it down the hole to melt the ice.  If you are
wondering what a 2500m deep hole in ice looks like, an example is above.</p>

<p>So what kinds of daily activities are required to run this operation?</p>

<p>[singlepic id=415 w=200 float=right] Taping is one of the most critical and
boring parts of the job.  The hose we use to pump water down the hole cannot
support its own weight, so it is necessary to tape a support cable to it.
This happens roughly once every minute for the entire drill operation.  On the
way down we have to put the tape on.  On the way up we take it off.  It takes
roughly 36 hours to drill a hole, so that equates to over 2000 taping
operations.  Everyone on the team takes turns doing this to ensure that no one
is going insane taping.  But I have taped for over 5 hours straight before.
To pass the time we frequently make things out of the used up tape.  Earlier
in the season I made a bull head and horns.  Unfortunately one of the horns
broke off and it looks a little sad now.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=409 w=200 float=right] The other critical job during drilling is
running the computers.  This takes 2 people.  One person runs computers that
control the flow, temperature, and pressure of the water.  The other runs the
computers that control drilling speed.  When this drill is running smoothly,
this is fairly easy.</p>

<p>As you can see, it really only takes 3 or 4 people to run the drill when it is
sailing smooth.  The real work takes place between holes and when things go
wrong.  The entire system that heats and pressurizes the water contains
hundreds of valves, miles of piping and hose, and thousands of gallons of
water.  Heaters stop working.  Hoses burst.  Generators break.  Water tanks
overflow.  Stuff breaks and needs to be fixed quite often.  Many of the parts
we use were never designed to operate at such cold temperatures.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=419 w=200 float=right] Between holes it is also necessary to
move the entire drilling portion of the operation.  This is multiple huge hose
and cable reels, a two story tower, a support building, several hundred feet
of cable, a supply hose, etc.  The drill head also has to be pulled from each
hole and weighs over 800 lbs.  This is the time when having 10+ guys around is
extremely handy.  During the move we have to shut down flow to the entire
system, which we can only do for a little over an hour or else all the water
will start freezing in the hoses.</p>

<p>That is a quick summary of what I do down here.  The exciting news is that
drilling is done!  We completed 19 holes over the course of roughly 2 months.
We did this way ahead of shecdule.  As a result, we have today and tomorrow
off.  The rest of the week will be spent packing up the camp, winterizing
everything, and moving stuff to next years site.  Because we finished so far
ahead of schedule, I am also out of here 5 days early.  Originally scheduled
to leave Feb 9th, I am now leaving on the 4th.</p>

<p>That is it for now.  There is a big end of season party tonight, but hopefully
I will get to post some more updates with the couple days off.</p>
