  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was finally able to figure out how to photoshop two of the panoramic
shots I have made. They are REALLY big. Maybe later I will post some smaller
versions but in the meantime here there are:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I got to the airport at 6:30 am for a 9 am flight to the coast of
Antarctica. The flight ended up being delayed until around 12:30 pm. We flew
down in a LC-130 cargo plane operated by the US Air Force. The flight took
about 8 hours and was not comfortable at all! The seats are essentially canvas
folded out of the wall with cargo net backs. And the quarters are quite close.
You will have to wait for some pictures to see exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>The first 4 hours it was not a pleasant experience, but then the clouds
cleared and we could see out the window. It was absolutely breathtaking, a
true spectacle of nature’s raw beauty. As far as I could see were ice bergs,
mountains, crevasses, and the edge of the ice shelf. I spent a good portion of
2 hours just staring out the window. I also took lots of photos but there
isn’t enough internet bandwidth here to post them today. In any case I don’t
think photos could truly do the scene justice.</p>

<p>Stepping off the plane, it was warm! They are having record highs in McMurdo,
yesterday it was 39 degrees. As a result, many of the vehicles got stuck in
slush and we had to wait out on the runway for about an hour. From the runway,
located on the ice shelf, we took a short bus ride up to the station. The sun
is up 24 hours a day here so I though I might have trouble sleeping, but I hit
the pillow and was out cold.</p>

<p>This morning I have been catching up on some emails and taking care of some
logistics for the next leg of the journey. In the afternoon, another IceCuber,
Graham, and I went down to the point of McMurdo bay. At the very tip of the
point is the hut that Robert F Scott built on his Antarctic expedition. I took
many pictures of the hut, the station and the bay. Hopefully I will also get
those uploaded soon.</p>

<p>Right now I am scheduled to fly to the South Pole on Jan. 5th so I have a
couple days here to explore. I will post another update before I leave and
fingers crossed – some pictures. In the mean time check out the gallery for
some pictures of my time is Christchurch. The travel map is also updated so
you can see where McMurdo Station is located.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early this morning I got a call from Raytheon. I went to get fitted for all my
gear today, instead of tomorrow. Looks like there will be some weather issues
with leaving on Jan. 3rd so I have been bumped up to leave on the 2nd. That
means about 9am tomorrow I will be headed down to McMurdo Station.</p>

<p>McMurdo is on the coast of Antarctica and is the major base for the United
States Antarctic Program (USAP). Over a 1000 people are stationed there this
time of year. I should only be at McMurdo for a few days, but it will still be
exciting. There are several labs to tour and I might even see some penguins.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just arrived at the hotel in Christchurch, New Zealand. I left Boston at
10:00am Dec. 28th and arrived here at 10:30am Dec. 30th. Quite the journey,
but it went pretty smoothly, no major issues. I should definitely give a shout
out to Qantas airlines. Hands down it was the most comfortable flight I have
ever taken. The 13+ hours went by pretty quick.</p>

<p>Its 85 deg and sunny here in Christchurch. Pretty warm compared to the -6 deg
at the pole. The next few days should be pretty relaxed, just exploring
Christchurch and getting issued my cold weather gear. Over New Years I have
arranged to meet up with some people from
<a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a> It will be my first experience
with other couch surfers, but hopefully it works out.</p>

<p>I have also added a travel map at the very top of the web page. This map will
show all the places I have been. Give it a look
<a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=24">here</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to everyone that has subscribed over the last week or so. The site is
almost completely up and running. Just a few more bugs to work out. There will
be some cool new features as well. One of which will be a page with a Google
map that shows every place I have been in my journey.</p>

<p>Hopefully starting later this week I will get to start posting on a daily
basis about my experiences. If there is something you want me to talk about,
just leave a comment. In a few weeks I will try and write a couple of posts on
the science behind IceCube and what we are actually doing at the South Pole.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I am graduating college tomorrow. Those of you who have
talked to me over the last couple of days know it was a little touch and go
near the end, but everything has been worked out and I will actually be
graduating tomorrow. After graduation I am going back to Boston until I leave
for New Zealand on Dec. 28th. Look forward to more posts soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It turns out that you can send me mail while I am at the South Pole! Send it
to:</p>

<p>Steve Faulkner, A-333-S South Pole Station PSC 468 Box 400 APO AP 96598</p>

<p>Packages take up to 6 weeks to arrive so I would recommend sending a letter.
Letters take, on average, 5-14 days to arrive but can take longer depending on
the weather.</p>
