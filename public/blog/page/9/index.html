  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we had a distinguished guest at the South Pole. The Prince of Monaco
came to visit the station and gave a short speech. He is on a tour of 26
Antarctic stations promoting environmentalism and Monaco recent signing of the
Antarctic Treaty. In honor of the Prince&#8217;s visit I thought I would talk a
little about people who visit the pole.</p>

<p>Every year there are some private flights that are chartered to the South Pole
and the always fill up. You can sign up through a company known as
<a href="http://www.antarctic-logistics.com/programs_b.html">ALE</a>,  but it is quite
expensive. Roughly $38,000 to visit the pole.</p>

<p>Last week we had an ALE fight come in with some interesting people. One was a
rich guy from Alabama that bought half of of the station&#8217;s store out. Another
was a very old lady, probably over 80. Apparently she had to be on oxygen the
entire time and almost collapsed walking back to the plane.</p>

<p>There are also guests hosted by the NSF. The Prince of Monaco was one of them.
On my flight to the pole was the former president of Slovakia. I really don&#8217;t
know why he was here, or what interest he had in Antarctica.</p>

<p>Next week there is a group from the House Committee on Commerce, Justice, and
Science. I don&#8217;t know if any congressmen are in the group, but I will
definitely keep you all updated.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry for the lack of updates over the last few day. There have been some
internet issues at the station. But in that time I made another video slide
show! This one shows how pretty much every morning goes for me at the South
Pole. Hope you enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>No big update today. I&#8217;ll have some good pics tomorrow. I just wanted to make
a post asking for questions from you guys. I still have a few topics to cover,
things to show you, but I am interested to know what questions you all have.
Leave your questions in the comments, I will do my best to answer them in a
post while I am down here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several people asked me before I left:</p>

<p>_&#8221;Is there really a red and white pole at the South Pole?&#8221; _</p>

<p>The answer is yes&#8230;.and no.  Lets explore a little deeper and look at some
pictures.</p>

<p><strong>The &#8220;Ceremonial&#8221;  South Pole:</strong> These are some pictures from the ceremonial south pole. As you can see it is red and white striped. This is like the touristy spot, where all the hip people get there picture taken. But is it really at the South Pole? Not quite&#8230;. [singlepic id=374 w=380] [singlepic id=376 w=380]<br/>
<strong>The &#8220;Real&#8221; South Pole:</strong> Below are some pictures of the real south pole. It is about 50 ft from the ceremonial pole. Why? Here a the pole we are on a huge ice sheet, several thousand meters deep. Most of Antarctica is essentially one massive glacier and like any glacier, it moves. In this case about 10 meters a year. So every year they have to move the marker for the real south pole, but the ceremonial pole stays in place, moving farther and farther away. [singlepic id=379 w=380] [singlepic id=378 w=380]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>First off, I am planning on sending out a bunch of postcards in the next week
or so. If you would like to recieve one, just leave your address in a comment
and I&#8217;ll get one too you.</p>

<p>Finally after leaving on Dec. 28th, I arrived around 3pm on Jan 5th at the
South Pole. It felt like a long journey. On the way down I have been reading a
book about the first US expedition to Antarctica. They were gone for over 4
years! Its nice to think that in the event of an emergency I am only a few
plane flights away from warm weather.</p>

<p>Today is my first day of actual work. So far I have just been lounging around
trying to get aclimated to the altitude. The other issue here is the dry air.
Indoors, the relative humidity is roughtly 5%. Last night I put some clothes
up to dry in my room and were bone dry in about an hour. I&#8217;ll give a detailed
post of the living conditions later, but its a little rough. I have to go
outside and into another building to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p>My shift starts at 6:30am and but its 6am here. We only get internet 9 hours a
day, so I have to get up early to check my email and post. This is definitely
an issue for me. It puts internet and sleept, two things I value highly, at
odds.</p>

<p>I have to go to work now, but I will give some more detailed posts soon.
Remember, if you want a post card, leave your address in the comments.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone. Sorry for the short update but I have arrived at the South Pole.
I only have 2 minutes left on the satellite uplink so I have to go, but I will
give more information and post some pictures soon.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I was finally able to figure out how to photoshop two of the panoramic
shots I have made. They are REALLY big. Maybe later I will post some smaller
versions but in the meantime here there are:</p>

<p><a href="http://users.frozenliquid.net/~faulkner/photos/poi%0Antpano%20copy.jpg">Discovery Point Panoramic</a></p>

<p><a href="http://users.frozenliquid.net/~faulkner/photos/panorama%20copy.jpg">Observation Hill
Panoramic</a></p>

<p>I recommend you right click on the link above and save it to your computer. Be
warned they are large and if you try and view them in your browser it may take
a while! Here is the smaller one:</p>

video slide show of some highlights. Check it out!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday I got to the airport at 6:30 am for a 9 am flight to the coast of
Antarctica. The flight ended up being delayed until around 12:30 pm. We flew
down in a LC-130 cargo plane operated by the US Air Force. The flight took
about 8 hours and was not comfortable at all! The seats are essentially canvas
folded out of the wall with cargo net backs. And the quarters are quite close.
You will have to wait for some pictures to see exactly what I mean.</p>

<p>The first 4 hours it was not a pleasant experience, but then the clouds
cleared and we could see out the window. It was absolutely breathtaking, a
true spectacle of nature’s raw beauty. As far as I could see were ice bergs,
mountains, crevasses, and the edge of the ice shelf. I spent a good portion of
2 hours just staring out the window. I also took lots of photos but there
isn’t enough internet bandwidth here to post them today. In any case I don’t
think photos could truly do the scene justice.</p>

<p>Stepping off the plane, it was warm! They are having record highs in McMurdo,
yesterday it was 39 degrees. As a result, many of the vehicles got stuck in
slush and we had to wait out on the runway for about an hour. From the runway,
located on the ice shelf, we took a short bus ride up to the station. The sun
is up 24 hours a day here so I though I might have trouble sleeping, but I hit
the pillow and was out cold.</p>

<p>This morning I have been catching up on some emails and taking care of some
logistics for the next leg of the journey. In the afternoon, another IceCuber,
Graham, and I went down to the point of McMurdo bay. At the very tip of the
point is the hut that Robert F Scott built on his Antarctic expedition. I took
many pictures of the hut, the station and the bay. Hopefully I will also get
those uploaded soon.</p>

<p>Right now I am scheduled to fly to the South Pole on Jan. 5th so I have a
couple days here to explore. I will post another update before I leave and
fingers crossed – some pictures. In the mean time check out the gallery for
some pictures of my time is Christchurch. The travel map is also updated so
you can see where McMurdo Station is located.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Early this morning I got a call from Raytheon. I went to get fitted for all my
gear today, instead of tomorrow. Looks like there will be some weather issues
with leaving on Jan. 3rd so I have been bumped up to leave on the 2nd. That
means about 9am tomorrow I will be headed down to McMurdo Station.</p>

<p>McMurdo is on the coast of Antarctica and is the major base for the United
States Antarctic Program (USAP). Over a 1000 people are stationed there this
time of year. I should only be at McMurdo for a few days, but it will still be
exciting. There are several labs to tour and I might even see some penguins.</p>
