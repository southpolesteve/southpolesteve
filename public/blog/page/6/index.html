  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a few lazy days in Bangkok, I am headed to Cambodia tomorrow.  I was
actually quite close to booking a flight home, but then something pretty
amazing happened.  Through <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing</a>, I met
a girl from NYC doing a photo essay on travelers.  She took me on some local
tours of Bangkok and got me convinced not to end my trip quite yet.</p>

<p>It is sometimes crazy how life gives you what you need, right when you need
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I know, I have been neglecting the website! Apologies to everyone.
Sometimes relaxing takes priority.  I am still in Phuket, Thailand and
tonight I am flying to Bangkok.  Once I am there I will try and post all the
pictures I have taken over the past couple weeks.  In the meantime, here are
some things I have been doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Went to a Muay Thai boxing match</li>
<li>Got certified as a PADI open water SCUBA diver</li>
<li>Saw sharks, eels, very poisonous fish, octopuses that change color, and dolphins while diving</li>
<li>Spent an entire day hoping between local islands and snorkeling</li>
<li>Visited several Buddhist temples</li>
<li>Went to a traditional Thai wedding and sat right next to the family!  (There were easily over 800 people there!)</li>
<li>Was blessed and given a good luck charm by a Buddhist monk</li>
<li>Taught a lesson on Antarctica to middle school Thai students<br/>
Each of these probably deserves their own post!  At the least I hope to get
some pics up soon.   Now, I have to go pack for Bangkok and Cambodia&#8230;.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arrived in Thailand a couple nights ago. A very different country compared to
the other places I have been so far. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have internet at
the place I am staying, so updates to this site might not be too frequent. I
will do the best I can.</p>

<p>The plan is to stay here for at least a few weeks. I am staying with my friend
Annie who teaches English here and has a spare bed. Her place is just a 10
minute walk from a pristine beach. It is definitely pretty sweet and I am
enjoying it so far.</p>

<p>No real plans yet of what I will be doing here, but tomorrow I am visiting the
school with Annie and giving a lesson on the South Pole! Hopefully it goes
well. More next time!</p>

Handfeeding kangaroos was awesome.  Also, I have trained monkeys hard at work

something good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am pretty convinced that Singapore is the shopping capital of the world.
Literally mall after mall after mall. Every store you can imagine. One of the
malls had a Yamaha floor. Not a store, a floor. An entire floor devoted to
everything Yamaha - Pianos, Guitars, ATVs, Trumpets, Audio Equipment, etc.
Another mall had a bread store. A huge store that had every kind of bread,
pie, cake, bun, biscuit you can think of.</p>

<p>The most exciting mall for me has been the Sim Lim Square. This is a 6 story
mall of nothing but tech gadgets and electronics. Another really interesting
experience was going to the movies. This afternoon I decided to cool off in a
cinema and was suprised at a couple things. First, the movie theatres here
have extremely comfortable seats, way more comfortable than the US. Second,
your seats are reserved. You select your seat on a touch screen when you buy
the ticket and you are required to sit in that seat.</p>

<p>More to come as I keep exploring the city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone, sorry for no updates ove the past few days, but the place I was
at in Australia had no internet.  I just arrived in Singapore.  The travel map
is updated.  I took a lot of pictures in Australia and I will post them as
soon as I get the chance.  The two highlights of Australia were definitely
surfing and handfeeding Kangaroos.  Today I am trying to get some visas in
Singapore and explore the city a little bit.  More later!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a FYI.  There is a really good way to view pictures in the gallery.
Click on the link that says &#8220;view with pic lens&#8221; and it will bring up a really
nice browser for all the images.  For you tech savvy people, you can also
install a add on to Firefox called Pic Lens that will allow you to browse
through the images on a sweet 3-d wall. [singlepic id=977 w=525]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=925 w=250 float=right] Here it is. The road trip post!  A quick
rundown of my week driving all over New Zealand&#8217;s south island.  The pictures
are all posted on the <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3">pictures
page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Feb 9th - Christchurch to Oamaru:</strong><br/>
Mike and I rented a car from a very cute little punk rock chick in downtown
Christchurch.  Left in the afternoon and headed down to Oamaru.  On the way we
stopped in Raikia Gorge to snap some photos.  In Oamaru we just made it in
time to see the penguins come out.  We went down to observation point, but it
was quite difficult to see them as we were high up on the cliffs.  That night
we stayed in a little shack of a hostel, but it was run by some very nice
people.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2 - Feb 10th - Oamaru to Te Anau:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=888 w=250 float=right] Most of the morning was spent driving
down the coast past Dunedin, then we turned inland.  The low hills are quite
pretty in New Zealand, and there are sheep and cows everywhere.  That night we
got to Te Anau and hopped on a sunset cruise and tour of the glow worm caves.
The caves are quite amazing.  It is just what it sounds like, thousands of
tiny glow worms light up thecave with small blue lights.  The highlight is the
last room of the cave where it actually feels like looking at a starry sky
rather than the ceiling of a cave.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3 - Feb 11th - Te Anau to Wanaka:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=579 w=250 float=right] We had to wake up around 5am to drive to
Milford Sound - the highlight of the trip.  The drive takes a couple hours
through stunning valleys, fiords, and lakes.  Then we took a two hour cruise
of the sound.  I took nearly <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3&amp;album=2&amp;gallery=13">300
picutres</a> while
we were there.  Definitely check them out, but they don&#8217;t really do the
scenery justice.  On the way out we stopped and hiked up to a waterfall coming
off a high glacier.  We found out later that it was off limits.  Whoops.  That
afternoon we drove back to Te Anau and then all the way to Wanaka, a small
town up by a mountain lake.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4 - Feb 12th - Wanaka to Hanmer Springs:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=958 w=250 float=right] Probably our longest day of driving.  In
the morning we drove to the west coast and stopped at Fox glacier.  We hiked
up to the observation point, which was quite far away from the face of the
glacier.  There were all kinds of signs warning of dangerous slides, ice
falls, rocks, and surging water past that point.  We promptly ignored the
signs and went right up to the face and the river coming from the glacier.
That afternoon we drove all the way to Hanmer Springs and crashed for the
night.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5 - Feb 13th - Hanmer Springs to Christchurch :</strong><br/>
The morning in Hanmer Springs was spent soaking in hot pools and sulfer pools.
Very relaxing, all though they stretched the idea of &#8220;natural&#8221; a bit.  Mid day
we drove back down to Christchurch to meet some friends of my dad - Nigel and
Wendy Gilchrist.  They invited us to join them for a fantastic dinner party
with fresh scallops, lobster and whitebait.</p>

<p><strong>Day 6 - Feb 14th - In Christchurch :</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=968 w=250 float=right] Mike left back for the states in the
morning.  In the late afternoon Nigel took me to my first professional rugby
match.  It was very exciting and I think I finally have a handle on how the
game is played.</p>

<p><strong>Day 7 - Feb 15th - To Brisbane, Australia:</strong><br/>
Today is day 7.  I am leaving this afternoon for 5 days in Brisbane,
Australia.  Then on Feb 20th I am headed to Singapore.  It has been a great
time in New Zealand.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to post about a tenth of the
experiences I have had here, but I am looking forward to more in other
countries!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey, sorry for no updates, but I have been on the road in New Zealand and
staying in places with little or no internet. No time to post either. We have
covered over 2000km in about 3.5 days, so been busy driving. I will try and
get a detailed update soon and post a few hundred pictures. I have also
finalized plans for leaving New Zealand. I am flying to Brisbane, Australia on
Feb 15th and to Singapore on Feb 20th. That&#8217;s all I have time for right now.
More to come soon!</p>
