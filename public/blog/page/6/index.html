  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am pretty convinced that Singapore is the shopping capital of the world.
Literally mall after mall after mall. Every store you can imagine. One of the
malls had a Yamaha floor. Not a store, a floor. An entire floor devoted to
everything Yamaha - Pianos, Guitars, ATVs, Trumpets, Audio Equipment, etc.
Another mall had a bread store. A huge store that had every kind of bread,
pie, cake, bun, biscuit you can think of.</p>

<p>The most exciting mall for me has been the Sim Lim Square. This is a 6 story
mall of nothing but tech gadgets and electronics. Another really interesting
experience was going to the movies. This afternoon I decided to cool off in a
cinema and was suprised at a couple things. First, the movie theatres here
have extremely comfortable seats, way more comfortable than the US. Second,
your seats are reserved. You select your seat on a touch screen when you buy
the ticket and you are required to sit in that seat.</p>

<p>More to come as I keep exploring the city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone, sorry for no updates ove the past few days, but the place I was
at in Australia had no internet.  I just arrived in Singapore.  The travel map
is updated.  I took a lot of pictures in Australia and I will post them as
soon as I get the chance.  The two highlights of Australia were definitely
surfing and handfeeding Kangaroos.  Today I am trying to get some visas in
Singapore and explore the city a little bit.  More later!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a FYI.  There is a really good way to view pictures in the gallery.
Click on the link that says &#8220;view with pic lens&#8221; and it will bring up a really
nice browser for all the images.  For you tech savvy people, you can also
install a add on to Firefox called Pic Lens that will allow you to browse
through the images on a sweet 3-d wall. [singlepic id=977 w=525]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=925 w=250 float=right] Here it is. The road trip post!  A quick
rundown of my week driving all over New Zealand&#8217;s south island.  The pictures
are all posted on the <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3">pictures
page</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Day 1 - Feb 9th - Christchurch to Oamaru:</strong><br/>
Mike and I rented a car from a very cute little punk rock chick in downtown
Christchurch.  Left in the afternoon and headed down to Oamaru.  On the way we
stopped in Raikia Gorge to snap some photos.  In Oamaru we just made it in
time to see the penguins come out.  We went down to observation point, but it
was quite difficult to see them as we were high up on the cliffs.  That night
we stayed in a little shack of a hostel, but it was run by some very nice
people.</p>

<p><strong>Day 2 - Feb 10th - Oamaru to Te Anau:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=888 w=250 float=right] Most of the morning was spent driving
down the coast past Dunedin, then we turned inland.  The low hills are quite
pretty in New Zealand, and there are sheep and cows everywhere.  That night we
got to Te Anau and hopped on a sunset cruise and tour of the glow worm caves.
The caves are quite amazing.  It is just what it sounds like, thousands of
tiny glow worms light up thecave with small blue lights.  The highlight is the
last room of the cave where it actually feels like looking at a starry sky
rather than the ceiling of a cave.</p>

<p><strong>Day 3 - Feb 11th - Te Anau to Wanaka:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=579 w=250 float=right] We had to wake up around 5am to drive to
Milford Sound - the highlight of the trip.  The drive takes a couple hours
through stunning valleys, fiords, and lakes.  Then we took a two hour cruise
of the sound.  I took nearly <a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3&amp;album=2&amp;gallery=13">300
picutres</a> while
we were there.  Definitely check them out, but they don&#8217;t really do the
scenery justice.  On the way out we stopped and hiked up to a waterfall coming
off a high glacier.  We found out later that it was off limits.  Whoops.  That
afternoon we drove back to Te Anau and then all the way to Wanaka, a small
town up by a mountain lake.</p>

<p><strong>Day 4 - Feb 12th - Wanaka to Hanmer Springs:</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=958 w=250 float=right] Probably our longest day of driving.  In
the morning we drove to the west coast and stopped at Fox glacier.  We hiked
up to the observation point, which was quite far away from the face of the
glacier.  There were all kinds of signs warning of dangerous slides, ice
falls, rocks, and surging water past that point.  We promptly ignored the
signs and went right up to the face and the river coming from the glacier.
That afternoon we drove all the way to Hanmer Springs and crashed for the
night.</p>

<p><strong>Day 5 - Feb 13th - Hanmer Springs to Christchurch :</strong><br/>
The morning in Hanmer Springs was spent soaking in hot pools and sulfer pools.
Very relaxing, all though they stretched the idea of &#8220;natural&#8221; a bit.  Mid day
we drove back down to Christchurch to meet some friends of my dad - Nigel and
Wendy Gilchrist.  They invited us to join them for a fantastic dinner party
with fresh scallops, lobster and whitebait.</p>

<p><strong>Day 6 - Feb 14th - In Christchurch :</strong><br/>
[singlepic id=968 w=250 float=right] Mike left back for the states in the
morning.  In the late afternoon Nigel took me to my first professional rugby
match.  It was very exciting and I think I finally have a handle on how the
game is played.</p>

<p><strong>Day 7 - Feb 15th - To Brisbane, Australia:</strong><br/>
Today is day 7.  I am leaving this afternoon for 5 days in Brisbane,
Australia.  Then on Feb 20th I am headed to Singapore.  It has been a great
time in New Zealand.  I haven&#8217;t even been able to post about a tenth of the
experiences I have had here, but I am looking forward to more in other
countries!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey, sorry for no updates, but I have been on the road in New Zealand and
staying in places with little or no internet. No time to post either. We have
covered over 2000km in about 3.5 days, so been busy driving. I will try and
get a detailed update soon and post a few hundred pictures. I have also
finalized plans for leaving New Zealand. I am flying to Brisbane, Australia on
Feb 15th and to Singapore on Feb 20th. That&#8217;s all I have time for right now.
More to come soon!</p>

<p>PS, the travel map has been updated:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=525 w=200 float=right] Today, some drillers and I took a day
trip out to the Banks Peninsula and the town of Akaroa. It is a small touristy
village with boat cruises, sea kayaking, and whale watching. We mostly just
bummed around town all afternoon and then headed back tonight. While we were
in town they had a pretty neat airshow. This was apparently related to the
national holiday that was yesterday - <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waitangi_Day">Waitangi
Day</a>. The country side was also
quite beautiful so you will have to check out some of the pictures in the
album.  Reminds me a lot of the costal hills in California combined with a
seaside Oregon town.  Also, lots of sheep were present.  Fact: There are more
sheep than people in New Zealand.</p>

<p>Edit: Whoops, I had that fact turned around before</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>In roughly 12 hours I will be leaving the South Pole.  It has been a great
time, but if I stay much longer I will be stuck here all winter.  That is not
something I am quite ready to do.  It also comes at a good time, as the
temperature has dropped about 20 F in the past day.  That means wind chills of
-65 F and less!</p>

<p>I&#8217;ll get on a 3 hour LC-130 flight to McMurdo Station in the morning.  At
McMurdo, if everything runs smoothly, I will transfer to a C-17.  This is a
much larger cargo plane that is only used at the beginning and end of the
season.  The main advantage is that it is much faster.  The flight from
Christchurch to McMurdo took 8 hours on the way down , but the return trip
will only take 5.  It will also most likely have semi-normal airline seats
instead of jump seats.  First class Antarctic travel!  The photo below shows a
comparison between the two planes.</p>
