  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally after a few hours I managed to upload pics of the bus crash</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1331 w=500]</p>

<p>The travel map has also been somewhat updated.</p>

<p>In other news, over the last few days I have gotten a little sick.  I have
some travel info books with me, so I&#8217;m 99% sure is a bacterial infection going
on my with my intestine.  So last night I bought antibiotics for 4 bucks from
a shady pharmacy in Cambodia.  They pretty much had every drug known to man
available over the counter.  Good news is I am feeling better already</p>

<p>PS :My mom is going to freak out when she reads this, and think I am dying
from a rare tropical disease  in Camboida.  Mom, I am OK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a trip already.  A 5 hour bus ride to the border, a hour at the border
getting a visa.  Then a taxi to the bus station.  Then the bus to Siem Reap
(Angkor Wat)&#8230;.</p>

<p>Our bus driver drove the bus off the road!</p>

<p>We all had to get off, as the bus was literally on edge and in danger of
falling off the road entirely.  The sun then went down and we waited for over
an hour while several trucks tried to drag us out.   Quiet an intense
experience for only being in the country a few hours.  Finally though, I made
to Siem Reap but much later than expected.</p>

<p>I have some pics of the bus, but can&#8217;t upload them yet.  Internet speeds are
glacial in Cambodia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a few lazy days in Bangkok, I am headed to Cambodia tomorrow.  I was
actually quite close to booking a flight home, but then something pretty
amazing happened.  Through <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing</a>, I met
a girl from NYC doing a photo essay on travelers.  She took me on some local
tours of Bangkok and got me convinced not to end my trip quite yet.</p>

<p>It is sometimes crazy how life gives you what you need, right when you need
it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yes, I know, I have been neglecting the website! Apologies to everyone.
Sometimes relaxing takes priority.  I am still in Phuket, Thailand and
tonight I am flying to Bangkok.  Once I am there I will try and post all the
pictures I have taken over the past couple weeks.  In the meantime, here are
some things I have been doing:</p>

<ul>
<li>Went to a Muay Thai boxing match</li>
<li>Got certified as a PADI open water SCUBA diver</li>
<li>Saw sharks, eels, very poisonous fish, octopuses that change color, and dolphins while diving</li>
<li>Spent an entire day hoping between local islands and snorkeling</li>
<li>Visited several Buddhist temples</li>
<li>Went to a traditional Thai wedding and sat right next to the family!  (There were easily over 800 people there!)</li>
<li>Was blessed and given a good luck charm by a Buddhist monk</li>
<li>Taught a lesson on Antarctica to middle school Thai students<br/>
Each of these probably deserves their own post!  At the least I hope to get
some pics up soon.   Now, I have to go pack for Bangkok and Cambodia&#8230;.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Arrived in Thailand a couple nights ago. A very different country compared to
the other places I have been so far. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t have internet at
the place I am staying, so updates to this site might not be too frequent. I
will do the best I can.</p>

<p>The plan is to stay here for at least a few weeks. I am staying with my friend
Annie who teaches English here and has a spare bed. Her place is just a 10
minute walk from a pristine beach. It is definitely pretty sweet and I am
enjoying it so far.</p>

<p>No real plans yet of what I will be doing here, but tomorrow I am visiting the
school with Annie and giving a lesson on the South Pole! Hopefully it goes
well. More next time!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=3">The picture page</a> has been updated
with pictures from Australia.  Make sure to check out the Lone Pine photos.
Handfeeding kangaroos was awesome.  Also, I have trained monkeys hard at work
on a video slideshow of Australia and New Zealand.  Hopefully they churn out
something good.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am pretty convinced that Singapore is the shopping capital of the world.
Literally mall after mall after mall. Every store you can imagine. One of the
malls had a Yamaha floor. Not a store, a floor. An entire floor devoted to
everything Yamaha - Pianos, Guitars, ATVs, Trumpets, Audio Equipment, etc.
Another mall had a bread store. A huge store that had every kind of bread,
pie, cake, bun, biscuit you can think of.</p>

<p>The most exciting mall for me has been the Sim Lim Square. This is a 6 story
mall of nothing but tech gadgets and electronics. Another really interesting
experience was going to the movies. This afternoon I decided to cool off in a
cinema and was suprised at a couple things. First, the movie theatres here
have extremely comfortable seats, way more comfortable than the US. Second,
your seats are reserved. You select your seat on a touch screen when you buy
the ticket and you are required to sit in that seat.</p>

<p>More to come as I keep exploring the city.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone, sorry for no updates ove the past few days, but the place I was
at in Australia had no internet.  I just arrived in Singapore.  The travel map
is updated.  I took a lot of pictures in Australia and I will post them as
soon as I get the chance.  The two highlights of Australia were definitely
surfing and handfeeding Kangaroos.  Today I am trying to get some visas in
Singapore and explore the city a little bit.  More later!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just a FYI.  There is a really good way to view pictures in the gallery.
Click on the link that says &#8220;view with pic lens&#8221; and it will bring up a really
nice browser for all the images.  For you tech savvy people, you can also
install a add on to Firefox called Pic Lens that will allow you to browse
through the images on a sweet 3-d wall. [singlepic id=977 w=525]</p>
