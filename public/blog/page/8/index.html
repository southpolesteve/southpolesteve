  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=439 w=270 float=right] Every Sunday night at the Pole is the
&#8220;Sunday Science Lecture&#8221;.  This past Sunday it was on the South Pole
Telescope.  I won&#8217;t get into all the details, but they are using it to find
evidence of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter">dark matter</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Energy">dark
energy</a>.  It was quite interesting,
and it is really cool to hear these cutting edge scientists give informal
talks about their work.  Of course, the best part was they gave everyone free
South Pole Telescope t-shirts.  Later this week I might head out to the
telescope site and see if I can get a tour.  They are located really close to
IceCube, so I might be able to do it right after work.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two nights ago was the annual South Pole In-Da-Continent Film Festival.
Otherwise known as SPIFF.  They show a bunch of short films made by people
here at the station.  One of the films was very interesting, even though it
was just a simple interview.</p>

<p>Earlier this season a skier arrived at the pole nearly about to collapse from
exhaustion.  He started cross country skiing from the edge of the continent,
but broke his ski binding on the 4th day in.  Instead of turning around he
decided to keep going - to walk to the pole.  He ended up making it on Dec.
23rd and in the process broke the world record for walking to the South Pole.</p>

<p>The video shown at SPIFF was an interview taken soon after he arrived at the
station.  I found it very interesting.  He is still extremely in touch with
all of the emotions associated with his trip and it was really cool to hear
him talk about what he went through when it was still so fresh in his mind.</p>

<p>IceCube has been kind enough to post it on their website
<a href="http://icecube.wisc.edu/~krasberg/pictures/Spiff-MarkKandShelbyH.mov">here</a>.
I recommend checking it out if you get the chance.  A warning though, the file
is over 2 GB in size.  It may take a while to download, so be aware.</p>

<time datetime="2009-01-24T08:58:15-05:00" pubdate data-updated="true">Jan 24<span>th</span>, 2009</time>
        
      </p>
    
  </div>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=417 w=200 float=right] First off, I should apologize.  I haven&#8217;t
done a post on work yet, and for the most part there isn&#8217;t much left.  Some of
you might not know that I work for the <a href="http://www.icecube.wisc.edu">IceCube</a>
project.  I have linked to their website, so if you want to know more about
the science, check it out.  I will try and do a post on the science behind the
project a little later, but it can get pretty complicated.</p>

<p>What you should know is that my job mostly revolves around drilling extremely
large holes.  Holes in the ice sheet that are roughly 2500m deep and 0.5m
wide.  To make these holes, we heat water up to 190 F and pressurize it to
1000 PSI.  Then we pump it down the hole to melt the ice.  If you are
wondering what a 2500m deep hole in ice looks like, an example is above.</p>

<p>So what kinds of daily activities are required to run this operation?</p>

<p>[singlepic id=415 w=200 float=right] Taping is one of the most critical and
boring parts of the job.  The hose we use to pump water down the hole cannot
support its own weight, so it is necessary to tape a support cable to it.
This happens roughly once every minute for the entire drill operation.  On the
way down we have to put the tape on.  On the way up we take it off.  It takes
roughly 36 hours to drill a hole, so that equates to over 2000 taping
operations.  Everyone on the team takes turns doing this to ensure that no one
is going insane taping.  But I have taped for over 5 hours straight before.
To pass the time we frequently make things out of the used up tape.  Earlier
in the season I made a bull head and horns.  Unfortunately one of the horns
broke off and it looks a little sad now.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=409 w=200 float=right] The other critical job during drilling is
running the computers.  This takes 2 people.  One person runs computers that
control the flow, temperature, and pressure of the water.  The other runs the
computers that control drilling speed.  When this drill is running smoothly,
this is fairly easy.</p>

<p>As you can see, it really only takes 3 or 4 people to run the drill when it is
sailing smooth.  The real work takes place between holes and when things go
wrong.  The entire system that heats and pressurizes the water contains
hundreds of valves, miles of piping and hose, and thousands of gallons of
water.  Heaters stop working.  Hoses burst.  Generators break.  Water tanks
overflow.  Stuff breaks and needs to be fixed quite often.  Many of the parts
we use were never designed to operate at such cold temperatures.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=419 w=200 float=right] Between holes it is also necessary to
move the entire drilling portion of the operation.  This is multiple huge hose
and cable reels, a two story tower, a support building, several hundred feet
of cable, a supply hose, etc.  The drill head also has to be pulled from each
hole and weighs over 800 lbs.  This is the time when having 10+ guys around is
extremely handy.  During the move we have to shut down flow to the entire
system, which we can only do for a little over an hour or else all the water
will start freezing in the hoses.</p>

<p>That is a quick summary of what I do down here.  The exciting news is that
drilling is done!  We completed 19 holes over the course of roughly 2 months.
We did this way ahead of shecdule.  As a result, we have today and tomorrow
off.  The rest of the week will be spent packing up the camp, winterizing
everything, and moving stuff to next years site.  Because we finished so far
ahead of schedule, I am also out of here 5 days early.  Originally scheduled
to leave Feb 9th, I am now leaving on the 4th.</p>

<p>That is it for now.  There is a big end of season party tonight, but hopefully
I will get to post some more updates with the couple days off.</p>

<p>A couple days ago we had some interesting people arrive at the pole.  They
actually drove right up behind our drill camp.  Some other people and I had
the pleasure of welcoming them to the South Pole.</p>

<p>Turns out it was a team of Norwegians supporting a ski race.  The cool part
was that they were driving modified Toyota trucks and had driven them all the
way to the South Pole.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the South Pole, there are two places that people live.  The first is the
new South Pole Station.  It is quite comfortable and where I spend a lot of
time eating and socializing.  But  unfortunately that is not where my room is.
My room is located in the &#8220;Summer Camp&#8221; .</p>

<p>Summer Camp is a collection of a dozen or so buildings that are only used
during the South Pole summer.  Most of the buildings are insulated army-style
barracks built in the late 60&#8217;s called Jamesways.  Pretty much everyone sleeps
in the Jamesways their first year, so its not out of the ordinary that I am
here.  None the less, it would still be much nicer to live in the new station.
Below is a composited picture of my room in the Jamesway:</p>

<p>[singlepic id=389 w=400]</p>

<p>The standard room consists of just a bed and a heavy canvas curtain as a door.
These room have been here for so long that many, including mine, have been
modified.  Some industrious person has constructed a desk , some shelves, and
added more insulation to the walls.  These rooms are also prone to air leaks
from the outside, but luckily many have been plugged with old towels.</p>

<p>The shelves are probably the most useful part, as the temperature can vary
widely from the top of the room to the bottom.  Anything left on the floor is
likely to freeze if left there for more than 24 hours.  On the opposite end,
it is upwards of 85° F  at the top near the heat duct.</p>

<p>Not the most comfortable living arrangements, but I only sleep there.  Most of
my free time is spent up a the station.  I will have to do another post about
South Pole recreation, but right now it is time to go to work&#8230;</p>

  </div>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>During this time of year, the South Pole summer, there is 24 hours of
daylight.  The sun just stays at a constant angle and rotates around your
head.  At first I thought this was cool. There is no bad time of day to do
anything.  Take pictures, work, visit the pole.  As long as you are awake it
doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>Now, it is starting to get on my nerves a little.  The body&#8217;s circadian rhythm
is hard to trick.  After being here for a couple weeks my body is starting to
wonder why it isn&#8217;t getting dark.  Often I will spend a couple hours at night
inside the station watching a movie.  My brain knows that it was light when I
went inside. Since it is late in the day, my mind expects it to be dark when I
go back outside.  When I walk back to my hut and it is bright as midday, I get
a slight sense of confusion.  I don&#8217;t know of a better way to explain it.</p>

<p>Definitely looking forward to seeing the night sky again&#8230;.</p>

      </p>
    
  </div>


  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several people posted in the comments about the food at the South Pole.  Last
night we had quite the meal here, so I thought it would be only appropriate to
post about it today.  We&#8217;re going to look at three categories: The Good, The
Bad, and The Ugly.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br/>
Like I said previously, the meal last night was quite awesome.  We had king
crab legs and fillet Mignon, both of which were awesome.  Everything at the
South Pole is buffet style.  I took full advantage and ate 3 plate fulls of
what you see below.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=387 w=250]</p>

<p>Usually one meal of the day is pretty delicious.  Good dishes have been:
Chicken Fried Steak, Fish and Chips, Custom Omelets.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong><br/>
Not all the food was as good as last night.  A common issue with having
everything buffet style is that you frequently have leftovers, especially if a
dish doesn&#8217;t get eaten.  The cooks often turn the leftovers into soups, stir
fry, or salads.  We have had pizza salad, sweet and sour pork soup, &#8220;tastes
pretty good&#8221; salad, etc.  Usually these are a couple days after the main dish
is served.  The truth is that the main dishes were never good to begin with ,
so the leftover dishes leave something to be desired.</p>

<p>Bad meals have been: Turkey wraps (with nasty reconstituted turkey), Semi-
Rancid Bacon, Sweet and Sour Pork.</p>

<p><strong>The Ugly:</strong><br/>
Through one of the drillers we have a connection to get some of the extra food
that is in storage.  Currently we have 4 cases of corn dogs stockpiled out at
our work site.  This is what I usually eat for breakfast.</p>

<p>The South Pole also has a large emergency food cache that they rotate every 10
years.  I happened to be here during the rotation, so I got to try some of the
food.  The most interesting item was the Bacon Bar&#8230;</p>

<p>[singlepic id=384 w=250]</p>

<p>[singlepic id=386 w=250]</p>

<p>This is basically a slab of deep fried bacon that is compressed and seasoned.
It looks and feels like something resembling a power bar.  It was also
packaged on June 11th, 1986.  I did try it, and it tasted pretty good!  But
I&#8217;m not gonna lie, it was a little weird eating something that was packaged
before I was born.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we had a distinguished guest at the South Pole. The Prince of Monaco
came to visit the station and gave a short speech. He is on a tour of 26
Antarctic stations promoting environmentalism and Monaco recent signing of the
Antarctic Treaty. In honor of the Prince&#8217;s visit I thought I would talk a
little about people who visit the pole.</p>

<p>Every year there are some private flights that are chartered to the South Pole
and the always fill up. You can sign up through a company known as
<a href="http://www.antarctic-logistics.com/programs_b.html">ALE</a>,  but it is quite
expensive. Roughly $38,000 to visit the pole.</p>

<p>Last week we had an ALE fight come in with some interesting people. One was a
rich guy from Alabama that bought half of of the station&#8217;s store out. Another
was a very old lady, probably over 80. Apparently she had to be on oxygen the
entire time and almost collapsed walking back to the plane.</p>

<p>There are also guests hosted by the NSF. The Prince of Monaco was one of them.
On my flight to the pole was the former president of Slovakia. I really don&#8217;t
know why he was here, or what interest he had in Antarctica.</p>

<p>Next week there is a group from the House Committee on Commerce, Justice, and
Science. I don&#8217;t know if any congressmen are in the group, but I will
definitely keep you all updated.</p>
