<p>A couple days ago we had some interesting people arrive at the pole.  They
actually drove right up behind our drill camp.  Some other people and I had
the pleasure of welcoming them to the South Pole.</p>

<p>Turns out it was a team of Norwegians supporting a ski race.  The cool part
was that they were driving modified Toyota trucks and had driven them all the
way to the South Pole.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the South Pole, there are two places that people live.  The first is the
new South Pole Station.  It is quite comfortable and where I spend a lot of
time eating and socializing.  But  unfortunately that is not where my room is.
My room is located in the &#8220;Summer Camp&#8221; .</p>

<p>Summer Camp is a collection of a dozen or so buildings that are only used
during the South Pole summer.  Most of the buildings are insulated army-style
barracks built in the late 60&#8217;s called Jamesways.  Pretty much everyone sleeps
in the Jamesways their first year, so its not out of the ordinary that I am
here.  None the less, it would still be much nicer to live in the new station.
Below is a composited picture of my room in the Jamesway:</p>

<p>[singlepic id=389 w=400]</p>

<p>The standard room consists of just a bed and a heavy canvas curtain as a door.
These room have been here for so long that many, including mine, have been
modified.  Some industrious person has constructed a desk , some shelves, and
added more insulation to the walls.  These rooms are also prone to air leaks
from the outside, but luckily many have been plugged with old towels.</p>

<p>The shelves are probably the most useful part, as the temperature can vary
widely from the top of the room to the bottom.  Anything left on the floor is
likely to freeze if left there for more than 24 hours.  On the opposite end,
it is upwards of 85° F  at the top near the heat duct.</p>

<p>Not the most comfortable living arrangements, but I only sleep there.  Most of
my free time is spent up a the station.  I will have to do another post about
South Pole recreation, but right now it is time to go to work&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>During this time of year, the South Pole summer, there is 24 hours of
daylight.  The sun just stays at a constant angle and rotates around your
head.  At first I thought this was cool. There is no bad time of day to do
anything.  Take pictures, work, visit the pole.  As long as you are awake it
doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

<p>Now, it is starting to get on my nerves a little.  The body&#8217;s circadian rhythm
is hard to trick.  After being here for a couple weeks my body is starting to
wonder why it isn&#8217;t getting dark.  Often I will spend a couple hours at night
inside the station watching a movie.  My brain knows that it was light when I
went inside. Since it is late in the day, my mind expects it to be dark when I
go back outside.  When I walk back to my hut and it is bright as midday, I get
a slight sense of confusion.  I don&#8217;t know of a better way to explain it.</p>

<p>Definitely looking forward to seeing the night sky again&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several people posted in the comments about the food at the South Pole.  Last
night we had quite the meal here, so I thought it would be only appropriate to
post about it today.  We&#8217;re going to look at three categories: The Good, The
Bad, and The Ugly.</p>

<p><strong>The Good:</strong><br/>
Like I said previously, the meal last night was quite awesome.  We had king
crab legs and fillet Mignon, both of which were awesome.  Everything at the
South Pole is buffet style.  I took full advantage and ate 3 plate fulls of
what you see below.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=387 w=250]</p>

<p>Usually one meal of the day is pretty delicious.  Good dishes have been:
Chicken Fried Steak, Fish and Chips, Custom Omelets.</p>

<p><strong>The Bad:</strong><br/>
Not all the food was as good as last night.  A common issue with having
everything buffet style is that you frequently have leftovers, especially if a
dish doesn&#8217;t get eaten.  The cooks often turn the leftovers into soups, stir
fry, or salads.  We have had pizza salad, sweet and sour pork soup, &#8220;tastes
pretty good&#8221; salad, etc.  Usually these are a couple days after the main dish
is served.  The truth is that the main dishes were never good to begin with ,
so the leftover dishes leave something to be desired.</p>

<p>Bad meals have been: Turkey wraps (with nasty reconstituted turkey), Semi-
Rancid Bacon, Sweet and Sour Pork.</p>

<p><strong>The Ugly:</strong><br/>
Through one of the drillers we have a connection to get some of the extra food
that is in storage.  Currently we have 4 cases of corn dogs stockpiled out at
our work site.  This is what I usually eat for breakfast.</p>

<p>The South Pole also has a large emergency food cache that they rotate every 10
years.  I happened to be here during the rotation, so I got to try some of the
food.  The most interesting item was the Bacon Bar&#8230;</p>

<p>[singlepic id=384 w=250]</p>

<p>[singlepic id=386 w=250]</p>

<p>This is basically a slab of deep fried bacon that is compressed and seasoned.
It looks and feels like something resembling a power bar.  It was also
packaged on June 11th, 1986.  I did try it, and it tasted pretty good!  But
I&#8217;m not gonna lie, it was a little weird eating something that was packaged
before I was born.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we had a distinguished guest at the South Pole. The Prince of Monaco
came to visit the station and gave a short speech. He is on a tour of 26
Antarctic stations promoting environmentalism and Monaco recent signing of the
Antarctic Treaty. In honor of the Prince&#8217;s visit I thought I would talk a
little about people who visit the pole.</p>

<p>Every year there are some private flights that are chartered to the South Pole
and the always fill up. You can sign up through a company known as
<a href="http://www.antarctic-logistics.com/programs_b.html">ALE</a>,  but it is quite
expensive. Roughly $38,000 to visit the pole.</p>

<p>Last week we had an ALE fight come in with some interesting people. One was a
rich guy from Alabama that bought half of of the station&#8217;s store out. Another
was a very old lady, probably over 80. Apparently she had to be on oxygen the
entire time and almost collapsed walking back to the plane.</p>

<p>There are also guests hosted by the NSF. The Prince of Monaco was one of them.
On my flight to the pole was the former president of Slovakia. I really don&#8217;t
know why he was here, or what interest he had in Antarctica.</p>

<p>Next week there is a group from the House Committee on Commerce, Justice, and
Science. I don&#8217;t know if any congressmen are in the group, but I will
definitely keep you all updated.</p>

a post asking for questions from you guys. I still have a few topics to cover,

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Several people asked me before I left:</p>

<p>_&#8221;Is there really a red and white pole at the South Pole?&#8221; _</p>

<p>The answer is yes&#8230;.and no.  Lets explore a little deeper and look at some
pictures.</p>

<p><strong>The &#8220;Ceremonial&#8221;  South Pole:</strong> These are some pictures from the ceremonial south pole. As you can see it is red and white striped. This is like the touristy spot, where all the hip people get there picture taken. But is it really at the South Pole? Not quite&#8230;. [singlepic id=374 w=380] [singlepic id=376 w=380]<br/>
<strong>The &#8220;Real&#8221; South Pole:</strong> Below are some pictures of the real south pole. It is about 50 ft from the ceremonial pole. Why? Here a the pole we are on a huge ice sheet, several thousand meters deep. Most of Antarctica is essentially one massive glacier and like any glacier, it moves. In this case about 10 meters a year. So every year they have to move the marker for the real south pole, but the ceremonial pole stays in place, moving farther and farther away. [singlepic id=379 w=380] [singlepic id=378 w=380]</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone,</p>

<p>First off, I am planning on sending out a bunch of postcards in the next week
or so. If you would like to recieve one, just leave your address in a comment
and I&#8217;ll get one too you.</p>

<p>Finally after leaving on Dec. 28th, I arrived around 3pm on Jan 5th at the
South Pole. It felt like a long journey. On the way down I have been reading a
book about the first US expedition to Antarctica. They were gone for over 4
years! Its nice to think that in the event of an emergency I am only a few
plane flights away from warm weather.</p>

<p>Today is my first day of actual work. So far I have just been lounging around
trying to get aclimated to the altitude. The other issue here is the dry air.
Indoors, the relative humidity is roughtly 5%. Last night I put some clothes
up to dry in my room and were bone dry in about an hour. I&#8217;ll give a detailed
post of the living conditions later, but its a little rough. I have to go
outside and into another building to go to the bathroom.</p>

<p>My shift starts at 6:30am and but its 6am here. We only get internet 9 hours a
day, so I have to get up early to check my email and post. This is definitely
an issue for me. It puts internet and sleept, two things I value highly, at
odds.</p>

<p>I have to go to work now, but I will give some more detailed posts soon.
Remember, if you want a post card, leave your address in the comments.</p>
