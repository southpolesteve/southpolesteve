have a whole day left of 2008 at home. I&#8217;ll have pictures and updates about
Christchurch tomorrow, but right now its time to get some sleep.</p>

<p>Happy New Year!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just arrived at the hotel in Christchurch, New Zealand. I left Boston at
10:00am Dec. 28th and arrived here at 10:30am Dec. 30th. Quite the journey,
but it went pretty smoothly, no major issues. I should definitely give a shout
out to Qantas airlines. Hands down it was the most comfortable flight I have
ever taken. The 13+ hours went by pretty quick.</p>

<p>Its 85 deg and sunny here in Christchurch. Pretty warm compared to the -6 deg
at the pole. The next few days should be pretty relaxed, just exploring
Christchurch and getting issued my cold weather gear. Over New Years I have
arranged to meet up with some people from
<a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing.com</a> It will be my first experience
with other couch surfers, but hopefully it works out.</p>

<p>I have also added a travel map at the very top of the web page. This map will
show all the places I have been. Give it a look
<a href="http://www.southpolesteve.com/?page_id=24">here</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Thanks to everyone that has subscribed over the last week or so. The site is
almost completely up and running. Just a few more bugs to work out. There will
be some cool new features as well. One of which will be a page with a Google
map that shows every place I have been in my journey.</p>

<p>Hopefully starting later this week I will get to start posting on a daily
basis about my experiences. If there is something you want me to talk about,
just leave a comment. In a few weeks I will try and write a couple of posts on
the science behind IceCube and what we are actually doing at the South Pole.</p>

<p>In the meantime, I am graduating college tomorrow. Those of you who have
talked to me over the last couple of days know it was a little touch and go
near the end, but everything has been worked out and I will actually be
graduating tomorrow. After graduation I am going back to Boston until I leave
for New Zealand on Dec. 28th. Look forward to more posts soon!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It turns out that you can send me mail while I am at the South Pole! Send it
to:</p>

<p>Steve Faulkner, A-333-S South Pole Station PSC 468 Box 400 APO AP 96598</p>

<p>Packages take up to 6 weeks to arrive so I would recommend sending a letter.
Letters take, on average, 5-14 days to arrive but can take longer depending on
the weather.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just got word from Raytheon.  I have PQ&#8217;d!  This basically means I am
medically clear to go to the South Pole.</p>

<p>PQ stands for Physically Qualified</p>

<p>Raytheon is the company that handles all the logistics for the US Polar
Programs.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally had my last blood draw today.  The first time they forgot to go some
tests so I had to go in again.  I think its easily been 20 vials of blood over
the past couple weeks.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hey everyone! Finally got everything up and running for the most part. Now I
just need to start writing. This blog should be a good way for everyone I know
to keep updated about what I am doing at the South Pole. Please leave
