staying at is ridiculously small. The picture was taken standing outside of
the bathroom. Also, you can barely see it but there is a shower spigot on the
left side of the wall. To take a shower I sit in the sink&#8230;. [singlepic

<p>As a side note, YouTube has started stripping the audio from videos where they
detect you are using a copyrighted song.  Luckily my other videos are fine,
but there are now thousands of videos on YouTube that are eerily silent.  And
yet again, the music industry continutes to piss off its own customers&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am in a dilema.  Currently I am in Vietnam. The original plan was to fly to
Malaysia for the Formula One race, but that will leave me 10 days or less in
Vietnam.  I really would like to go to a Grand Prix, so the next option is to
head north and hit the Grand Prix of China in mid-April.  So I am putting the
question to the readers!  What do you think I should do?  Vote now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just bought my bus ticket, leaving in one hour.  Cambodia has been insane
though!  I have really enjoyed it here.  Its quite a unique country and very
different from the others around it.</p>

<p>I will be in Vietnam for about 10 days and then the plan is to fly to Malaysia
for the Malaysian F1 Grand Prix.  This isn&#8217;t for sure yet, but it is the
general plan.  Depends on how much I enjoy Vietnam.  Another option is just to
got to China and then the Chinese Grand Prix in Mid-April.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went to two very intense places around Phnom Phen. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng">Tuol Sleng
Prison</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choeung_Ek">Choeung
Ek</a> killing fields. Quite an
harrowing experience. To see the hundreds of skulls stacked in the stupa at
Choeung Ek was particularly chilling sight. With the internet speeds here I
can&#8217;t post any pictures yet, but I highly recommend clicking through to the
links and learning a little more. The Khmer Rouge only ran Cambodia for 4
years, but over 1.5 million people died during that time. It is not something
we hear about too much in the US.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A common question I get:</p>

<p>What it is like to travel alone, and do I meet people along the way?</p>

<p>Well the truth is that it sometimes gets lonely.  But being alone forces me to
talk to people I probably wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet.</p>

<p>First off, I get to meet some of the locals.  In Bangkok, while waiting for a
boat, I met an old man who lived near by.  He was trying to improve his
English, and apparently he goes to movies a lot so he can learn.  We talked
about The Dark Night, Milk, Valkaryie and Slumdog Millionaire.</p>

<p>On buses, especially, I meet other travelers.  When there is a bus full of
locals, and only a couple foreigners, its easy to start a conversation.  On
the way to Cambodia I chatted for a while with a guy from the Czech Republic,
and ended up splitting a hotel room for one night with a girl from Holland.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just meet people randomly.  In Cambodia, while scrambling up the
steps of a temple, I met a nice family from San Diego.  The dad works for the
Department of Defense and the whole family has lived in Singapore for the past
two years.</p>

<p>And of course as I am sitting here typing this, I am also talking to a younger
spanish couple about the temples and the good things to see in the area.  The
traveling world is quite friendly.  It is very easy to meet people, and some
of them are amazingly interesting as well.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally after a few hours I managed to upload pics of the bus crash</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1331 w=500]</p>

<p>The travel map has also been somewhat updated.</p>

<p>In other news, over the last few days I have gotten a little sick.  I have
some travel info books with me, so I&#8217;m 99% sure is a bacterial infection going
on my with my intestine.  So last night I bought antibiotics for 4 bucks from
a shady pharmacy in Cambodia.  They pretty much had every drug known to man
available over the counter.  Good news is I am feeling better already</p>

<p>PS :My mom is going to freak out when she reads this, and think I am dying
from a rare tropical disease  in Camboida.  Mom, I am OK.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What a trip already.  A 5 hour bus ride to the border, a hour at the border
getting a visa.  Then a taxi to the bus station.  Then the bus to Siem Reap
(Angkor Wat)&#8230;.</p>

<p>Our bus driver drove the bus off the road!</p>

<p>We all had to get off, as the bus was literally on edge and in danger of
falling off the road entirely.  The sun then went down and we waited for over
an hour while several trucks tried to drag us out.   Quiet an intense
experience for only being in the country a few hours.  Finally though, I made
to Siem Reap but much later than expected.</p>

<p>I have some pics of the bus, but can&#8217;t upload them yet.  Internet speeds are
glacial in Cambodia.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After a few lazy days in Bangkok, I am headed to Cambodia tomorrow.  I was
actually quite close to booking a flight home, but then something pretty
amazing happened.  Through <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com">couchsurfing</a>, I met
a girl from NYC doing a photo essay on travelers.  She took me on some local
tours of Bangkok and got me convinced not to end my trip quite yet.</p>

<p>It is sometimes crazy how life gives you what you need, right when you need
it.</p>
