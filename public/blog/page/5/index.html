  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=1348 float=right w=300] For the past few days I have really been
enjoying a city called Hoi An, Vietnam.  It is about half way between Saigon
and Hanoi.  The best part, it is the consensus tailor-made clothing capitol of
the region.  Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore all have many good tailors,
but Hoi An has hundreds; in a city of only 75,000 people.  They also have a
many good historical sites and some UNESCO world heritage ruins near by.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was sucked in by all of the nice clothes and bought a lot.
Of course, they look and fit fantastic.  I couldn&#8217;t be happier and easily paid
less than 10% of what I would have paid for them in the US.  On top of this,
they are all custom tailored to my exact measurements.  Now I need to find a
job where linen and plaid suits are acceptable to wear to work.  I did get one
grey suit that is fairly tame, but the other clothes might be a little loud
for most office buildings.  On the other hand, I could just start a new
workplace trend.  Third option: I just don&#8217;t get a job at all.</p>

<p>In other news, I woke up from a nap yesterday and had a deep desire to leave
Vietnam and go to Malaysia for the Grand Prix.  It is interesting because for
the last week I was fairly confident I would be going to China and the Chinese
Grand Prix.  Luckily I found a string of flights that got me to Kuala Lumpur
tonight.  The downside is that I am currently waiting in the Saigon airport
for the next 7 hours.  Regardless, I went with my gut, and I am excited to see
the grand prix this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the road, I have a bit of free time. Whether on a bus, plane, or train, I
get to read a lot. So what have I been reading lately?</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1347 float=right w=100] The Road by Cormac McCarthy:  I read an
interview with McCarthy a few years ago, and I remember thinking he sounded
overrated and arrogant.  So I never picked up one of his books, even though he
won the Pulitzer for The Road and had No Country for Old Men turned into a
movie.  I had a change of heart in Cambodia and decided to give his Pulitzer
book a go.  It is amazing.  Tragic, but he really beautifully written.  I was
very impressed, although occasionally he likes to use words that probably only
a handful of people (and everyone who is studying for the GRE) know the
definition.  This grates on me a little.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1346 float=left w=100] American Psycho by Brent Easton Ellis:  I
got this book gifted to me by a Dutch girl the day I left Cambodia.  I have
never seen the movie.  First off, the book is quite sick, twisted, and
graphic.  This book is not for the light hearted.  Second, it is awesome.  The
shallowness of all these people in this high society world is very well
portrayed.  There is a particular scene involving everyone at the table
comparing business cards, and its fantastic.  The main character is absolutely
crushed when his doesn&#8217;t have the best typeface, color, thickness.  I am only
about half way through, but will probably finish in a few days because I can&#8217;t
stop reading it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first real scam attempt in South East Asia! So exciting. Here is how it
went down:</p>

<p>I was sitting in a park drinking a mango smoothie purchased from a woman
selling them out of the back of a pickup truck. A man comes and sits next to
me and starts making conversation. He soon tells me he is from Malaysia and
asks where I am from in the states. I tell him Wisconsin, and he starts
talking about his niece who is going to Wisconsin to work at a childrens
hosptial there. I ask him if it is the Madison Children&#8217;s Hosptial, and he
promptly says &#8220;Yes! Madison. I couldn&#8217;t remember the name before.&#8221; - Later, I
realized that he was just using and repeating what I was saying in order to
establish a connection.</p>

<p>His back story was that he is in town visitng his brother and mother. He wants
me to meet his niece, just to tell her about Madison and exchange information.
The niece is out shopping with her cousins, but he wants to take me to his
brother&#8217;s place where I can wait for 30 minutes untill they get back.
Everything so far seems pretty kosher. The man is nice enough and seems
legitmate&#8230;</p>

<p>So, we hop in a taxi and take a 10 minute ride to his brother&#8217;s house. I walk
in, they offer me drinks, and we all start chatting. Nothing too serious at
first, talking about Obama, F1, and traveling. He asks what I do for a living,
chat about that for a bit, and then I ask what he does&#8230;and here is where the
scamming starts.</p>

<p>He tells me that he is a casino manager. He asks me if I enjoy gambling, what
games I play, have I been to Las Vegas, etc. Then he tells me that he is being
reassigned and moving back to Malaysia next month. Next thing I know, he is
trying to convince me to come and stay at his Casino in Malaysia. He says he
can get me free rooms, free drinks, $100 a day in free slots, etc. At this
point I was getting pretty skeptical. I told him that I was planning on going
to Malaysia and I didn&#8217;t really know when, but I could email him when I got
there. He then started talking about which games to play, which ones were the
best for the casino, which were the best for the player.</p>

<p>Then he dropped the real bomb. He casually mentioned how Casinos, while so
closely watched in Vegas, were not well regulated in Malaysia. He then says he
could probably use his &#8220;influence&#8221; to give me an advantage over the house in a
few of the card games. When he said this, I knew for sure it was a scam. I
quickly looked at my watch and asked where his daughter was (it had been over
half an hour). He said she must be running late. I then told him that I really
didn&#8217;t like casinos and wasn&#8217;t interested in gambling on my trip. How quickly
the tables turned! He thanked me for coming and apologized for his daughters
abscence. He said he didn&#8217;t want to keep me any longer and 30 seconds later, I
was out on the front porch with a door in my face!</p>

<p>Other than being stranded in a part of town where no one seemed to speak
english, I came away no worse than before. I finally tracked down a cab and
made it to the train station just in time to catch the next train north.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just wanted to post a picture of this. The bathroom in the guest house I am
staying at is ridiculously small. The picture was taken standing outside of
the bathroom. Also, you can barely see it but there is a shower spigot on the
left side of the wall. To take a shower I sit in the sink&#8230;. [singlepic

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Finally, after 4 attempts to get a video on to YouTube, here it is!</p>

<p>As a side note, YouTube has started stripping the audio from videos where they
detect you are using a copyrighted song.  Luckily my other videos are fine,
but there are now thousands of videos on YouTube that are eerily silent.  And
yet again, the music industry continutes to piss off its own customers&#8230;.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I am in a dilema.  Currently I am in Vietnam. The original plan was to fly to
Malaysia for the Formula One race, but that will leave me 10 days or less in
Vietnam.  I really would like to go to a Grand Prix, so the next option is to
head north and hit the Grand Prix of China in mid-April.  So I am putting the
question to the readers!  What do you think I should do?  Vote now!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Just bought my bus ticket, leaving in one hour.  Cambodia has been insane
though!  I have really enjoyed it here.  Its quite a unique country and very
different from the others around it.</p>

<p>I will be in Vietnam for about 10 days and then the plan is to fly to Malaysia
for the Malaysian F1 Grand Prix.  This isn&#8217;t for sure yet, but it is the
general plan.  Depends on how much I enjoy Vietnam.  Another option is just to
got to China and then the Chinese Grand Prix in Mid-April.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today I went to two very intense places around Phnom Phen. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuol_Sleng">Tuol Sleng
Prison</a> and the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choeung_Ek">Choeung
Ek</a> killing fields. Quite an
harrowing experience. To see the hundreds of skulls stacked in the stupa at
Choeung Ek was particularly chilling sight. With the internet speeds here I
can&#8217;t post any pictures yet, but I highly recommend clicking through to the
links and learning a little more. The Khmer Rouge only ran Cambodia for 4
years, but over 1.5 million people died during that time. It is not something
we hear about too much in the US.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A common question I get:</p>

<p>What it is like to travel alone, and do I meet people along the way?</p>

<p>Well the truth is that it sometimes gets lonely.  But being alone forces me to
talk to people I probably wouldn&#8217;t otherwise meet.</p>

<p>First off, I get to meet some of the locals.  In Bangkok, while waiting for a
boat, I met an old man who lived near by.  He was trying to improve his
English, and apparently he goes to movies a lot so he can learn.  We talked
about The Dark Night, Milk, Valkaryie and Slumdog Millionaire.</p>

<p>On buses, especially, I meet other travelers.  When there is a bus full of
locals, and only a couple foreigners, its easy to start a conversation.  On
the way to Cambodia I chatted for a while with a guy from the Czech Republic,
and ended up splitting a hotel room for one night with a girl from Holland.</p>

<p>Sometimes, I just meet people randomly.  In Cambodia, while scrambling up the
steps of a temple, I met a nice family from San Diego.  The dad works for the
Department of Defense and the whole family has lived in Singapore for the past
two years.</p>

<p>And of course as I am sitting here typing this, I am also talking to a younger
spanish couple about the temples and the good things to see in the area.  The
traveling world is quite friendly.  It is very easy to meet people, and some
of them are amazingly interesting as well.</p>
