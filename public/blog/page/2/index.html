  <div class="entry-content"><p>Can&#8217;t help but post about this again. GPS tracking for sailing is pretty
awesome! Today I sailed 25 total miles and had a max speed of almost 10 mph.
Thats pretty quick for a sailboat. Also, I did a bunch of practice landings
while under sail. You can see on the map below how I kept circling around and
landing at the pier and a pin in the mooring field. At the end of the season I
think I&#8217;ll do a big summary that gives all kinds of interesting statistics
about my sailing this summer.</p>

very top of the page. If you did, you quickly realized there wasn&#8217;t much

redirected to Steve&#8217;s new personal landing page:

<p>I made it using this awesome site called <a href="http://flavors.me/">Flavors.Me</a>.  It
is a dead simple way to create an &#8220;About Me&#8221; page.  It also automatically
integrates  accounts from a ton of social media sites (Facebook, LinkedIn,
YouTube, Twitter, etc).  Highly recommended.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://www.redframe%0Aengineering.com/pics/cooler1.JPG"><img src="http://www.redframeengineering.com/pics/cooler1.JPG" alt="" /></a>I&#8217;m in the process of creating the &#8220;Ultimate
Sailing Cooler&#8221;. The motivation for this is just to have the most
technologically advanced cooler that ever existed. It will be used mostly for
sailing small dingy boats.  It will be completely ridiculous and over the top.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 1: Install Stereo Equipment and Electronics Compartment (In Progress)</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong> I completed this over the weekend. Bought some cheap marine speakers and an amplifier online. Hooked up to a 12v battery. The electronics are partitioned off from the rest of the cooler by a modified cutting board. Everything is sealed with silicone. All connections are just soldered and heat shrinked for the moment. Later, as it gets more finalized I will probably add connectors. Sounds great to far, but nothing to too technologically advanced. Input is from a small MP3 player.<br/>
<strong>Phase 2: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head-up_display">Heads Up Display</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System">GPS</a>, Temp Monitor (Parts Ordered)</strong><br/>
An <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/en/">Arduino</a> will run the whole thing. I have never
done Arduino work before, so I am excited to get my hands dirty. Inputs will
be a couple temp sensors and a GPS module. Outputs are to a 20x4 character LCD
that will be mounted on top of the cooler. GPS data will also be logged to an
SD card so I can overlay all my sailing this summer onto <a href="http://earth.google.com/">google
earth</a>. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_crystal_display">LCD
display</a> will be heading,
speed (knots), outside temp, cooler temp, battery life, and&#8230;.. anything else
I can think of. Maybe roll angle if I was adventurous and installed an
accelerometer.</p>

<p><strong>Phase 3: Solar Charging (Planned)</strong> Adding a 10 W <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photovoltaic_module">solar panel</a> to the top. There isn&#8217;t really a need for this, so of course it is a requirement for this cooler. It will also up the visible &#8216;cool&#8217; factor<br/>
<strong><a href="http://www.redframeengineering.com/pics/cooler%202.JPG"><img src="http://www.redframeengineering.com/pics/cooler%202.JPG" alt="" /></a>Phase 4: Connectivity (Out there)</strong> I will probably add bluetooth, wifi, or cellular connectivity. Maybe I will set up a tether to my phone so the cooler becomes a wifi hotspot. I need to come up with some more ideas here.<br/>
<strong>Phase 5: Mobility (WAY out there)</strong> If there is anyway I could make this move on its own, I might try. It will float, so I could add a propeller and a rudder system. Maybe some wheels and steering.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some of you might know, I am probably going to move to Iceland next
February.  I&#8217;ll be studying <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Geothermal_energy">geothermal
energy</a> at the <a href="http://www.res.is/">Renewable
Energy School</a> which is a private school that works in
combination with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iceland">University of
Iceland</a> and the
<a href="http://english.unak.is/">University of Akureyri</a>.  More details will come as
Febrauary gets closer.</p>

<p>Right now, I just want to assure everyone (mostly my mom) that I won&#8217;t end up
in the path of the recent volcanic eruptions.  Akureyri is almost 150 miles
from the eruption site and on the other side of the island.  See the map:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s post inspired by: <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-disruptive.html">http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-
disruptive.html</a></p>

<p>I normally like the <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com">Smart Bear blog.</a> His advice
is very sound and seems more in touch with the common folk than some <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com%0A/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html">other
blogs written from the clouds above Silicon Valley</a>.  But I didn&#8217;t quite agree with Smart Bear&#8217;s
words of wisdom today.  I&#8217;ll agree that the &#8220;disruptive&#8221; label is overused,
but I actually think that some of the examples he gave are quite disruptive.
Changing the landscape of an entire industry, or drastically altering the
lives of XXX million users are not required criteria for being disruptive.
Anytime you can make a successful company from just <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html">an
idea</a>,
that is being disruptive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Building a network of contacts is one of the most important things you can do.
My friend <a href="http://blog.justinkbeck.com">Jusitn Beck</a> did a great post about
this <a href="http://blog.justinkbeck.com/2010/02/networking-business-of-%0Ameeting-people.html">here</a>.  I agree with pretty much everything he said.  As for
me, almost every job I have worked was a directly result of networking.  The
only job that I got without &#8220;knowing someone&#8221; was my first job - cashier at
Best Buy.</p>

<p>This post was inspired by what happened to me yesterday.  I went to a clean
tech presentation given by the former CEO of <a href="http://www.virent.com/">Virent</a>
and the Current CEO of <a href="http://www.zbbenergy.com">ZBB batteries</a>, Eric
Apfelbach. After the talk, I met an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor">angel
investor</a> from Milwaukee and we
talked about business, entrepreneurship, and
<a href="http://www.geohuddle.com">GeoHuddle</a> for almost 3 hours.  I don&#8217;t know if he
will invest in <a href="http://www.geohuddle.com">GeoHuddle</a> anytime soon, but he is a
great contact to have and I am sure well be talking again soon.  It would have
been so easy to leave when the presentation was over, or not to go at all.
Bottom line: Talk to EVERYONE.  You never know who might be standing right
next to you.</p>
