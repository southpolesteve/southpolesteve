  <div class="entry-content"><p>As some of you might know, I am probably going to move to Iceland next
February.  I&#8217;ll be studying <a href="http://www.wikinvest.com/concept/Geothermal_energy">geothermal
energy</a> at the <a href="http://www.res.is/">Renewable
Energy School</a> which is a private school that works in
combination with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Iceland">University of
Iceland</a> and the
<a href="http://english.unak.is/">University of Akureyri</a>.  More details will come as
Febrauary gets closer.</p>

<p>Right now, I just want to assure everyone (mostly my mom) that I won&#8217;t end up
in the path of the recent volcanic eruptions.  Akureyri is almost 150 miles
from the eruption site and on the other side of the island.  See the map:</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today&#8217;s post inspired by: <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-disruptive.html">http://blog.asmartbear.com/not-
disruptive.html</a></p>

<p>I normally like the <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com">Smart Bear blog.</a> His advice
is very sound and seems more in touch with the common folk than some <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com%0A/rich-vs-king-sold-company.html">other
blogs written from the clouds above Silicon Valley</a>.  But I didn&#8217;t quite agree with Smart Bear&#8217;s
words of wisdom today.  I&#8217;ll agree that the &#8220;disruptive&#8221; label is overused,
but I actually think that some of the examples he gave are quite disruptive.
Changing the landscape of an entire industry, or drastically altering the
lives of XXX million users are not required criteria for being disruptive.
Anytime you can make a successful company from just <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/your-idea-sucks-now-go-do-it-anyway.html">an
idea</a>,
that is being disruptive.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Building a network of contacts is one of the most important things you can do.
My friend <a href="http://blog.justinkbeck.com">Jusitn Beck</a> did a great post about
this <a href="http://blog.justinkbeck.com/2010/02/networking-business-of-%0Ameeting-people.html">here</a>.  I agree with pretty much everything he said.  As for
me, almost every job I have worked was a directly result of networking.  The
only job that I got without &#8220;knowing someone&#8221; was my first job - cashier at
Best Buy.</p>

<p>This post was inspired by what happened to me yesterday.  I went to a clean
tech presentation given by the former CEO of <a href="http://www.virent.com/">Virent</a>
and the Current CEO of <a href="http://www.zbbenergy.com">ZBB batteries</a>, Eric
Apfelbach. After the talk, I met an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angel_investor">angel
investor</a> from Milwaukee and we
talked about business, entrepreneurship, and
<a href="http://www.geohuddle.com">GeoHuddle</a> for almost 3 hours.  I don&#8217;t know if he
will invest in <a href="http://www.geohuddle.com">GeoHuddle</a> anytime soon, but he is a
great contact to have and I am sure well be talking again soon.  It would have
been so easy to leave when the presentation was over, or not to go at all.
Bottom line: Talk to EVERYONE.  You never know who might be standing right
next to you.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>After seeing some of the horrific images coming out of Haiti, I started asking
myself this question. Actually, the first question I asked was, &#8220;How do I get
on a plane to Haiti?&#8221; After some research, it turns out experience is usually
required before they will put you on a plane and air drop you into a disaster
relief effort. Then I found myself wondering what I could do the next time
something like this happens. It turns out there is a great book that answers a
lot of these questions!</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pro%0Aduct/0060898771?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=soupolste-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;%0AcreativeASIN=0060898771">Emergency: This Book Will Save Your Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-%0Aamazon.com/e/ir?t=soupolste-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060898771" alt="" /> by Neil Strauss earlier
this year and its a great resource for anyone looking for more information
about what to do when all hell breaks loose. In the book, Niel highlights
Community Emergency Responder Training (CERT). CERT was developed by the Los
Angeles disaster management office and now is used by FEMA to train local
emergency responders all over the country. My friend Will and I are now signed
up for the local CERT class over the next two weekends. I&#8217;m really excited
about this and I&#8217;ll have to do a post about how it goes. I might be a long way
from drop shipping to a international disaster relief effort, but at least it
is a first step. If you have a couple free Saturdays and are interested in
finding out about how you can register for CERT <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/cc/searchCert.do?submitByZip">click

<p>This is starting to make some mainstream headlines.  It&#8217;s not entirely
benevolent on Google&#8217;s part, but the idea of a single company taking on an
entire government is interesting.  I think it&#8217;s with good intentions this
time, but what is to say this kind of pressuring can&#8217;t happen when the company
has less noble motives.  The truth is that it probably does happen but rarely
makes the evening news.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I realized that I have been neglecting this blog lately.  I guess since I&#8217;m
not half way across the world I kind of forgot about it.  Since my life has
become a little more normal, I figured I would start posting more often, and
posting about more traditional things. Life, TV shows, Politics, Tech, etc.
So here it goes!</p>

<p>I just wanted to direct you to this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/lenovo-ideapad-u1%0A-hybrid-laptop-by-day-unhinged-tablet-by-nigh/">http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/lenovo-ideapad-u1-hybrid-laptop-by-day-
unhinged-tablet-by-nigh/</a></p>

<p>Very cool!  Some of you might be aware that Apple is heavily rumored to be
releasing a tablet computer sometime at the end of January.  This product by
Lenovo is way cooler.  It is a tablet that I might actually use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry again for the lack of updates lately. I left Kuwait and came back to
Madison. Feels so good to be out of that country. I have moved into a place in
Madison that I will call home for the next 4 months. It is especially exciting
because I have two Danish roommates and one Australian. Through them and their
friends, I am getting a chance to meet people from all over the world right
here in Madison! Its been a ton of fun so far. For my birthday last night,
they made me a traditional danish dinner. We have been having a good time
learning about each others cultures. This semester should be great.</p>

<p>In other news, I am going to Colombia tomorrow. Just for fun. My friend
Jersey, who lives in the Dutch Antilles, has some time off and we are going to
bum around Bogota. Should be an awesome and exciting week! And one more
continent checked off the list. Only Europe and Africa to go&#8230;</p>
