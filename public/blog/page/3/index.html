  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its been a little while since my last update.  Not much new to report.  Kuwait
is still hot, and still one gigantic desert.  I am really looking forward to
getting back to the states and seeing some grass and trees.  I have less than
2 weeks left here, but the days are moving ultra slow.  We are having some
issues at work that are slowing the whole operation down.  Also, even though
we are inside, it still gets to 95 deg in the afternoon.  Not the makings of
an enjoyable 12 hour day.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a flight home yet, but I should know in the next couple days
exactly when I am coming back.  First stop will be in Madison, and then it is
out to California for my cousin Cade&#8217;s wedding.</p>

<p>Looking forward to feeling some cool wind off the bay.  Anyone know someone I
can go sailing with out in California?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I had my second day off since I got here.  The first day, I was still
out of it from jet lag. This is the first chance I have had to really do some
exploring.  The city I live in is called Mahboula, which I just found out is
Arabic for &#8220;mad woman&#8221;.  Its roughly 10 miles south of Kuwait City.</p>

<p>I spent the morning up in Kuwait City, going to several malls and trying to
find some good fake stuff.  Sadly, I was kind of dissapointed.  The fake stuff
in SE Asia is way better quality and cheaper.  I did go to some nicer malls as
well.  They have lots of big name brands just like in the US, but almost
everything is twice to three times as expensive.  In the afternoon I hit the
beach.  The water is very salty here.  I feel like it is saltier than normal
ocean water.</p>

<p>Next day off, I am going to try and take a ferry off the coast to Failaka
Island.  There are supposed to be some cool ruins there and also remnants of
the Iraqi invasion like tanks and jeeps.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of people have heard already, but I will be leaving much sooner
than expected.  I was supposed to be out here for 8 months, but I just quit my
job.  It was a hard thing for me to do, and there are a lot of reasons behind
it, but its the right decision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two long days of work so far at 12+ hour shifts.  Work has been a little rough
getting going.  Lots of logistical issues.  Today we have off, and then we go
back to work on Sunday.  There has been a little excitement.  Yesterday
afternoon, I was out on a test drive for one of the trucks and we ran out of
fuel.  It was 3 of us stuck in the desert for 2 hours in 115 deg heat waiting
for resuce.</p>

<p>Pics will hopefully be up soon.  Interestingly, its illegal to take pictures
of most everything here.  Malls, oil installations, warehouses, public
buildings, etc.  Security is very tight.  One of the guys I work with was
almost arrested last year for taking a picture of a Burger King.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s about 3AM here. Luckily I don&#8217;t have to start work tomorrow, so I can
adjust to the time change.  It is extremely hot, about 110 F when I got off
the plane.  The air also tastes kind of like burning oil.  Just stand in front
of your car exhaust for a while, and that&#8217;s exactly what it feels like in
Kuwait.</p>

<p>The new apartments they have for us are really nice.  Definitely a sweet
setup.  Right next door is the &#8220;Chicken King&#8221; where I ate my first meal in
Kuwait.  An entire rotisserie chicken, flatbread, hummus, and yogurt all for
$5.  Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>More details to come.  I need to try and get some more sleep.  It looks like
initially we will be working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week!  Better rest up&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>The time has come.  I am in Washington D.C. waiting to board the plane for
Kuwait.  The last couple weeks have been crazy getting everything ready to
leave.  I&#8217;m excited to start this new adventure, but a little sad too.  I have
to leave a bunch of friends behind, including an amazing girl named Megan.
Its only 8 months&#8230;time flies.</p>

<p>In other news, thanks to my dad, I get to fly out there business class - a 12
hour flight.  I fear that I will never be able to sit in coach again!</p>

<p>Look forward to lots of updates once I get there.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Some of you may have heard already, but it looks like I am headed to another
adventure.  I&#8217;m taking a job in Kuwait for the next 8 months.  I&#8217;ll be working
as a design engineer for military vehicle supsensions.  They want me to leave
onl July 10th!  Basically the next 10 days will be a complete whirlwind of
packing, doctors appointments and paperwork.  It is really sudden, but I am
excited because this job is pretty much exactly what I have been looking for.</p>

<p>That is all the info I have for now.  I&#8217;ll try and post some more later, and
of course look forward to some blogging from the Middle East.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Ever since my trip to SE Asia, I can&#8217;t eat like I used to.  Previously, I was
all about the junk food.  I still indulge every once and a while, but my
cravings for the unhealthy have definitely decreased.  <a href="http://www.presentationzen.com/presentationzen/2009/06/presenting-a%0A-case-for-healthy-food.html">This blog
post</a> has some great links and videos about the food we
eat in the US and the associated industry. Some surprising stuff, you should
check it out. Makes me wish for a a few more &#8220;third world&#8221; meals.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have set up a completely new photo gallery on the site. I was running into
some problems with the old one, hence the change. More importantly, I have
also uploaded every picture stored on my computer.  The photos are all
organized by location and then activity so they should be easy to navigate.
Feel free to browse the thousands of photos I took of <a href="ht%0Atp://photos.southpolesteve.com/Cambodia/Siem%20Reap/Angkor%20Temples/">temples in Cambodia</a> or some
photos from <a href="http://photos.southpolesteve.com/United%20%0AStates/Massachusettes/Boston/Red%20Sox%20-%20Patriots%20Day%20Game/">Fenway Park in Boston</a>. Or maybe
you are just interested in <a href="http://pho%0Atos.southpolesteve.com/United%20States/Illinois/img_1003.jpg.php">embarrassing photos of my friend Kayla</a>.</p>

for no updates, but there hasn&#8217;t been a whole lot to report.  Feels good to be

happens&#8230;</p>

<p>In the mean time I found a cool new thing that allow you to chat with me right
from this website.  I am mostly on google chat, so you will see my current
status just below. Click right on it and a new window will pop up where you
can chat with me. No logging in.  Pretty sweet.  In encourage you to try it
out.</p>
