  <div class="entry-content"><p>After seeing some of the horrific images coming out of Haiti, I started asking
myself this question. Actually, the first question I asked was, &#8220;How do I get
on a plane to Haiti?&#8221; After some research, it turns out experience is usually
required before they will put you on a plane and air drop you into a disaster
relief effort. Then I found myself wondering what I could do the next time
something like this happens. It turns out there is a great book that answers a
lot of these questions!</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/pro%0Aduct/0060898771?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=soupolste-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;%0AcreativeASIN=0060898771">Emergency: This Book Will Save Your Life</a><img src="http://www.assoc-%0Aamazon.com/e/ir?t=soupolste-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0060898771" alt="" /> by Neil Strauss earlier
this year and its a great resource for anyone looking for more information
about what to do when all hell breaks loose. In the book, Niel highlights
Community Emergency Responder Training (CERT). CERT was developed by the Los
Angeles disaster management office and now is used by FEMA to train local
emergency responders all over the country. My friend Will and I are now signed
up for the local CERT class over the next two weekends. I&#8217;m really excited
about this and I&#8217;ll have to do a post about how it goes. I might be a long way
from drop shipping to a international disaster relief effort, but at least it
is a first step. If you have a couple free Saturdays and are interested in
finding out about how you can register for CERT <a href="http://www.citizencorps.gov/cc/searchCert.do?submitByZip">click

<p>This is starting to make some mainstream headlines.  It&#8217;s not entirely
benevolent on Google&#8217;s part, but the idea of a single company taking on an
entire government is interesting.  I think it&#8217;s with good intentions this
time, but what is to say this kind of pressuring can&#8217;t happen when the company
has less noble motives.  The truth is that it probably does happen but rarely
makes the evening news.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I realized that I have been neglecting this blog lately.  I guess since I&#8217;m
not half way across the world I kind of forgot about it.  Since my life has
become a little more normal, I figured I would start posting more often, and
posting about more traditional things. Life, TV shows, Politics, Tech, etc.
So here it goes!</p>

<p>I just wanted to direct you to this post:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/lenovo-ideapad-u1%0A-hybrid-laptop-by-day-unhinged-tablet-by-nigh/">http://www.engadget.com/2010/01/04/lenovo-ideapad-u1-hybrid-laptop-by-day-
unhinged-tablet-by-nigh/</a></p>

<p>Very cool!  Some of you might be aware that Apple is heavily rumored to be
releasing a tablet computer sometime at the end of January.  This product by
Lenovo is way cooler.  It is a tablet that I might actually use.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Sorry again for the lack of updates lately. I left Kuwait and came back to
Madison. Feels so good to be out of that country. I have moved into a place in
Madison that I will call home for the next 4 months. It is especially exciting
because I have two Danish roommates and one Australian. Through them and their
friends, I am getting a chance to meet people from all over the world right
here in Madison! Its been a ton of fun so far. For my birthday last night,
they made me a traditional danish dinner. We have been having a good time
learning about each others cultures. This semester should be great.</p>

<p>In other news, I am going to Colombia tomorrow. Just for fun. My friend
Jersey, who lives in the Dutch Antilles, has some time off and we are going to
bum around Bogota. Should be an awesome and exciting week! And one more
continent checked off the list. Only Europe and Africa to go&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Its been a little while since my last update.  Not much new to report.  Kuwait
is still hot, and still one gigantic desert.  I am really looking forward to
getting back to the states and seeing some grass and trees.  I have less than
2 weeks left here, but the days are moving ultra slow.  We are having some
issues at work that are slowing the whole operation down.  Also, even though
we are inside, it still gets to 95 deg in the afternoon.  Not the makings of
an enjoyable 12 hour day.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t have a flight home yet, but I should know in the next couple days
exactly when I am coming back.  First stop will be in Madison, and then it is
out to California for my cousin Cade&#8217;s wedding.</p>

<p>Looking forward to feeling some cool wind off the bay.  Anyone know someone I
can go sailing with out in California?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I had my second day off since I got here.  The first day, I was still
out of it from jet lag. This is the first chance I have had to really do some
exploring.  The city I live in is called Mahboula, which I just found out is
Arabic for &#8220;mad woman&#8221;.  Its roughly 10 miles south of Kuwait City.</p>

<p>I spent the morning up in Kuwait City, going to several malls and trying to
find some good fake stuff.  Sadly, I was kind of dissapointed.  The fake stuff
in SE Asia is way better quality and cheaper.  I did go to some nicer malls as
well.  They have lots of big name brands just like in the US, but almost
everything is twice to three times as expensive.  In the afternoon I hit the
beach.  The water is very salty here.  I feel like it is saltier than normal
ocean water.</p>

<p>Next day off, I am going to try and take a ferry off the coast to Failaka
Island.  There are supposed to be some cool ruins there and also remnants of
the Iraqi invasion like tanks and jeeps.</p>

<p>Also, a lot of people have heard already, but I will be leaving much sooner
than expected.  I was supposed to be out here for 8 months, but I just quit my
job.  It was a hard thing for me to do, and there are a lot of reasons behind
it, but its the right decision.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Two long days of work so far at 12+ hour shifts.  Work has been a little rough
getting going.  Lots of logistical issues.  Today we have off, and then we go
back to work on Sunday.  There has been a little excitement.  Yesterday
afternoon, I was out on a test drive for one of the trucks and we ran out of
fuel.  It was 3 of us stuck in the desert for 2 hours in 115 deg heat waiting
for resuce.</p>

<p>Pics will hopefully be up soon.  Interestingly, its illegal to take pictures
of most everything here.  Malls, oil installations, warehouses, public
buildings, etc.  Security is very tight.  One of the guys I work with was
almost arrested last year for taking a picture of a Burger King.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>It&#8217;s about 3AM here. Luckily I don&#8217;t have to start work tomorrow, so I can
adjust to the time change.  It is extremely hot, about 110 F when I got off
the plane.  The air also tastes kind of like burning oil.  Just stand in front
of your car exhaust for a while, and that&#8217;s exactly what it feels like in
Kuwait.</p>

<p>The new apartments they have for us are really nice.  Definitely a sweet
setup.  Right next door is the &#8220;Chicken King&#8221; where I ate my first meal in
Kuwait.  An entire rotisserie chicken, flatbread, hummus, and yogurt all for
$5.  Not a bad deal.</p>

<p>More details to come.  I need to try and get some more sleep.  It looks like
initially we will be working 12 hours a day, 7 days a week!  Better rest up&#8230;</p>
