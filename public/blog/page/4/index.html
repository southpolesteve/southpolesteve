  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have set up a completely new photo gallery on the site. I was running into
some problems with the old one, hence the change. More importantly, I have
also uploaded every picture stored on my computer.  The photos are all

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I just had the worst thing on the planet.  Its almost midnight here, and in
the area not much is open for food.  I wandered down to McDonald&#8217;s and outside
MickeyD&#8217;s was a little hamburger stand.  I couldn&#8217;t read the menu, so I just
ordered what the guys standing around were having.  Here is, in order, how you
make one of these burgers:</p>

<p>Note: Any sauces must be added in triple portions.</p>

<ol>
<li>Deep fry 2 beef patties in half an inch of oil 2. Place a large scoop of
mayo and oyster sauce on each patty 3. Fry 2 eggs in the grease, but spread it
out omelet style. 4. Stack the patties and wrap in the egg 6. Add more mayo to
the top, more oyster sauce, and chili sauce. 7. Add one thin slice of lettuce
(vegetables!) 8. Place on 2 buns that have also been drenched in mayo 9. Serve</li>
</ol>


<p>I think it would have been a better choice to go to McDonald&#8217;s</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=1475 w=200 float=right] The F1 Grand Prix didn&#8217;t quite turn out
how I expected.  Almost every day here, in the late afternoon, it deluges for
a good 30-60 minutes.  Yesterday was no exception.  But, I am getting ahead of
myself.  The story starts on the bus ride too the track&#8230;</p>

<p>The track it self is about an hour away by bus.  I got on the bus at 2:00,
thinking I would be there well before the 5pm race.  Then we hit the traffic.
It might not have been so bad, except for the motorcades that kept coming
through.  Every 20 minutes a motorcade with police, range rovers, and some
ridiculously expensive car (Porsche, Bentley, Ferrari) would come along trying
to get through.  All the cars would have to move off to the side to make way
and then everyone scrambled back to fill the empty lanes.  It was a nightmare.</p>

<p>I missed the start of the race, but only by about 5 minutes.  For roughly the
first hour, it was fine.  The race was very exciting, but off in the distnace
you could see that rain was coming.  When the rain arrived, they had to stop
the race as the track was flooded in several parts.  Lightening was hitting
the grand stands and the TV tower (remember I am sitting on top of a big
hill!).  Finally they cancel the rest of the race and everyone leaves the
track.</p>

<p>After the race there is a free Jamiroquai concert.  I don&#8217;t even like the
band, but its better than waiting in the 2 hour line for a bus back to the
city.  So I wait 45 minutes to get into the concert.  It is held in a big
field next to the circuit and predictably is a HUGE mud puddle.  It starts
raining again.  After getting soaked through a second time and also covered
with mud, I leave to go wait for the bus.  Luckily I was able to find a rouge
bus company operating just down the street from the official bus.  This
prevents me from having to wait in the 2 hour line.  The ride back, due to
traffic again, takes almost 2 hours.  I arrive back at my hostel, wet, covered
in mud, and exhausted around 11:30.  Quick shower and I am asleep.</p>

<p>I think next year the FIA will think twice before having a late afternoon
start time.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>[singlepic id=1348 float=right w=300] For the past few days I have really been
enjoying a city called Hoi An, Vietnam.  It is about half way between Saigon
and Hanoi.  The best part, it is the consensus tailor-made clothing capitol of
the region.  Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, and Singapore all have many good tailors,
but Hoi An has hundreds; in a city of only 75,000 people.  They also have a
many good historical sites and some UNESCO world heritage ruins near by.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I was sucked in by all of the nice clothes and bought a lot.
Of course, they look and fit fantastic.  I couldn&#8217;t be happier and easily paid
less than 10% of what I would have paid for them in the US.  On top of this,
they are all custom tailored to my exact measurements.  Now I need to find a
job where linen and plaid suits are acceptable to wear to work.  I did get one
grey suit that is fairly tame, but the other clothes might be a little loud
for most office buildings.  On the other hand, I could just start a new
workplace trend.  Third option: I just don&#8217;t get a job at all.</p>

<p>In other news, I woke up from a nap yesterday and had a deep desire to leave
Vietnam and go to Malaysia for the Grand Prix.  It is interesting because for
the last week I was fairly confident I would be going to China and the Chinese
Grand Prix.  Luckily I found a string of flights that got me to Kuala Lumpur
tonight.  The downside is that I am currently waiting in the Saigon airport
for the next 7 hours.  Regardless, I went with my gut, and I am excited to see
the grand prix this weekend.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>On the road, I have a bit of free time. Whether on a bus, plane, or train, I
get to read a lot. So what have I been reading lately?</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1347 float=right w=100] The Road by Cormac McCarthy:  I read an
interview with McCarthy a few years ago, and I remember thinking he sounded
overrated and arrogant.  So I never picked up one of his books, even though he
won the Pulitzer for The Road and had No Country for Old Men turned into a
movie.  I had a change of heart in Cambodia and decided to give his Pulitzer
book a go.  It is amazing.  Tragic, but he really beautifully written.  I was
very impressed, although occasionally he likes to use words that probably only
a handful of people (and everyone who is studying for the GRE) know the
definition.  This grates on me a little.</p>

<p>[singlepic id=1346 float=left w=100] American Psycho by Brent Easton Ellis:  I
got this book gifted to me by a Dutch girl the day I left Cambodia.  I have
never seen the movie.  First off, the book is quite sick, twisted, and
graphic.  This book is not for the light hearted.  Second, it is awesome.  The
shallowness of all these people in this high society world is very well
portrayed.  There is a particular scene involving everyone at the table
comparing business cards, and its fantastic.  The main character is absolutely
crushed when his doesn&#8217;t have the best typeface, color, thickness.  I am only
about half way through, but will probably finish in a few days because I can&#8217;t
stop reading it.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>My first real scam attempt in South East Asia! So exciting. Here is how it
went down:</p>

<p>I was sitting in a park drinking a mango smoothie purchased from a woman
selling them out of the back of a pickup truck. A man comes and sits next to
me and starts making conversation. He soon tells me he is from Malaysia and
asks where I am from in the states. I tell him Wisconsin, and he starts
talking about his niece who is going to Wisconsin to work at a childrens
hosptial there. I ask him if it is the Madison Children&#8217;s Hosptial, and he
promptly says &#8220;Yes! Madison. I couldn&#8217;t remember the name before.&#8221; - Later, I
realized that he was just using and repeating what I was saying in order to
establish a connection.</p>

<p>His back story was that he is in town visitng his brother and mother. He wants
me to meet his niece, just to tell her about Madison and exchange information.
The niece is out shopping with her cousins, but he wants to take me to his
brother&#8217;s place where I can wait for 30 minutes untill they get back.
Everything so far seems pretty kosher. The man is nice enough and seems
legitmate&#8230;</p>

<p>So, we hop in a taxi and take a 10 minute ride to his brother&#8217;s house. I walk
in, they offer me drinks, and we all start chatting. Nothing too serious at
first, talking about Obama, F1, and traveling. He asks what I do for a living,
chat about that for a bit, and then I ask what he does&#8230;and here is where the
scamming starts.</p>

<p>He tells me that he is a casino manager. He asks me if I enjoy gambling, what
games I play, have I been to Las Vegas, etc. Then he tells me that he is being
reassigned and moving back to Malaysia next month. Next thing I know, he is
trying to convince me to come and stay at his Casino in Malaysia. He says he
can get me free rooms, free drinks, $100 a day in free slots, etc. At this
point I was getting pretty skeptical. I told him that I was planning on going
to Malaysia and I didn&#8217;t really know when, but I could email him when I got
there. He then started talking about which games to play, which ones were the
best for the casino, which were the best for the player.</p>

<p>Then he dropped the real bomb. He casually mentioned how Casinos, while so
closely watched in Vegas, were not well regulated in Malaysia. He then says he
could probably use his &#8220;influence&#8221; to give me an advantage over the house in a
few of the card games. When he said this, I knew for sure it was a scam. I
quickly looked at my watch and asked where his daughter was (it had been over
half an hour). He said she must be running late. I then told him that I really
didn&#8217;t like casinos and wasn&#8217;t interested in gambling on my trip. How quickly
the tables turned! He thanked me for coming and apologized for his daughters
abscence. He said he didn&#8217;t want to keep me any longer and 30 seconds later, I
was out on the front porch with a door in my face!</p>

<p>Other than being stranded in a part of town where no one seemed to speak
english, I came away no worse than before. I finally tracked down a cab and
made it to the train station just in time to catch the next train north.</p>
